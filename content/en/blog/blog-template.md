# Headings

Let's start with all possible headings. The HTML `<h1>`â€”`<h6>` elements represent six levels of section headings. `<h1>` is the highest section level and `<h6>` is the lowest.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

# Paragraph

According to the [HTML5 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#elements) by [W3C](https://www.w3.org/), **HTML documents consist of a tree of elements and text**. Each element is denoted in the source by a [start tag](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#syntax-start-tags), such as `<body>`, and an [end tag](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#syntax-end-tags), such as `</body>`. (*Certain start tags and end tags can in certain cases be omitted and are implied by other tags.*)

Elements can have attributes, which control how the elements work. For example, hyperlink are formed using the `a` element and its `href` attribute.
