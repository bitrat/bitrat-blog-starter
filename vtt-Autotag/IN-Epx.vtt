WEBVTT

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Expert1>:Let's engage with disabled people
about what we are going to do for them.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.850
<v Expert2>:We must remember to ensure
everyone is consulted, including a

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.810
small percentage of disabled people.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.000
It's fine for others to
speak on their behalf.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.630
<v Jonathan>:No, way, let's disrupt
the disability discourse.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.119
It's the Disability
Disrupters Podcast with Dr.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.020
Pam MacNeill.

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:14.269
<v Bill>:Disability Disrupters is
proudly brought to you by Disability

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:15.699
Responsiveness New Zealand.

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:21.259
At DRNZ, we produce and facilitate
workshops for non disabled people to

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.229
learn about how they can respond well
to the rights and needs of the one in

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.559
four people who experience disability.

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.379
We also develop and facilitate workshops
and mentoring programs for disabled

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:34.189
people so they can build a great life.

00:01:34.407 --> 00:01:37.487
<v Pam>:I'm joined today by Nikita Van Dyke.

00:01:37.647 --> 00:01:38.207
Hi Nikita.

00:01:38.207 --> 00:01:40.357
<v Nikita>:Kia ora, how are you?

00:01:40.927 --> 00:01:43.297
<v Pam>:Good, it's really great
to have you on the show.

00:01:43.997 --> 00:01:47.247
How about you start off by telling
us a little bit about yourself?

00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:53.102
<v Nikita>:Well, hi I'm Nikita, or
some people call me Nikki Van Dyke.

00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:55.562
I am disabled complexly.

00:01:56.132 --> 00:02:00.202
So I have several chronic illnesses,
including Ehlers Danlos Syndrome

00:02:00.242 --> 00:02:02.072
and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.

00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:03.752
I'm also neurodiverse.

00:02:04.192 --> 00:02:08.802
I'm a Master's student at the
University of Waikato undertaking

00:02:08.802 --> 00:02:12.402
a Master's in Disability and
Inclusion Studies, following a

00:02:12.412 --> 00:02:15.947
Bachelor's of arts and psychology.

00:02:16.607 --> 00:02:17.457
I'm in Whangarei.

00:02:17.957 --> 00:02:18.837
I love music.

00:02:18.897 --> 00:02:19.747
I love reading.

00:02:19.747 --> 00:02:21.607
I'm a little bit of a nerd as well.

00:02:21.657 --> 00:02:25.347
And I also have a big passion for
martial arts and self defense.

00:02:25.387 --> 00:02:31.397
I did Shaolin Kenpo competitively
for about 15 years and I

00:02:31.397 --> 00:02:34.707
still train personally as a
bit of a outlet for myself.

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:37.367
<v Pam>:And in your spare time, you breathe.

00:02:38.102 --> 00:02:39.032
<v Nikita>:Yeah, basically.

00:02:39.732 --> 00:02:40.672
Breathe and sleep.

00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:44.002
<v Pam>:Doesn't sound like you've
got much spare time at all.

00:02:44.362 --> 00:02:44.792
Gosh.

00:02:45.342 --> 00:02:46.482
<v Nikita>:But I love it that way.

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:49.882
<v Pam>:I'm really interested in
what you're talking about in

00:02:49.892 --> 00:02:52.022
terms of your martial arts.

00:02:52.022 --> 00:02:55.382
I guess you do that too to keep
fit, don't you, now that you're not

00:02:55.382 --> 00:02:57.172
so much into the competitive side?

00:02:57.882 --> 00:02:58.952
<v Nikita>:I do, yeah.

00:02:59.452 --> 00:03:02.842
<v Pam>:And you go to university,
you're doing a master's degree.

00:03:02.872 --> 00:03:07.082
Gosh I'm sure you and I could just do
an interview on going to university

00:03:07.082 --> 00:03:12.657
and  the complexities of that, but how
are you finding it as a disabled woman?

00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:16.217
<v Nikita>:I am finding it, I won't
lie, it's quite challenging.

00:03:16.347 --> 00:03:20.747
I'm quite lucky enough that my
master's programme is entirely hybrid.

00:03:21.307 --> 00:03:25.677
So I can study from home or if I
am in hospital or I need to travel

00:03:25.727 --> 00:03:27.367
for work, I can study anywhere.

00:03:27.897 --> 00:03:31.707
And then just to see my supervisors
on campus as needed but there's

00:03:31.707 --> 00:03:32.867
still its own challenges.

00:03:32.897 --> 00:03:37.947
A lot of tertiary institutes are
not set up properly for hybrid

00:03:37.947 --> 00:03:39.257
learning or online learning.

00:03:39.587 --> 00:03:42.307
A lot of staff don't
understand dynamic disability.

00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:45.697
I'm lucky that my supervisors
do, but throughout my educational

00:03:45.697 --> 00:03:46.487
journey, a lot of them don't.

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:50.587
Which has created its own challenges,
but it's also quite isolating studying

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:54.517
hybrid as a disabled person who's
already quite isolated from society.

00:03:54.937 --> 00:03:55.427
So,

00:03:56.237 --> 00:03:59.307
<v Pam>:yeah, I studied isolated
because it was through COVID.

00:03:59.317 --> 00:04:03.687
And I had actually just finished all
my research interviews with people,

00:04:03.697 --> 00:04:08.067
fortunately, and most of them actually had
been done over the phone or zoom anyway.

00:04:08.067 --> 00:04:12.057
But, it was during lockdown
that I actually started writing.

00:04:12.357 --> 00:04:16.737
So it kind of worked out okay for me,
but it is quite isolating, you're right.

00:04:16.777 --> 00:04:20.557
And I stopped going up to
Massey for my meetings and

00:04:20.557 --> 00:04:22.127
things, which I really missed.

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:25.247
There's nothing like being in the
same room with your supervisors.

00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:27.082
<v Nikita>:No, there's not.

00:04:27.132 --> 00:04:29.702
And I love my supervisors dearly.

00:04:30.072 --> 00:04:34.772
They not only challenge me, but they're so
empathetic and they're so understanding.

00:04:35.322 --> 00:04:38.842
And they're really kind people and
quite interesting to talk to as well.

00:04:39.992 --> 00:04:41.752
<v Pam>:Are they disabled people themselves?

00:04:42.902 --> 00:04:44.262
<v Nikita>:I'm not 100 percent sure.

00:04:44.512 --> 00:04:48.612
I know one of them, Katrina,
studies inclusion with a bit of

00:04:48.612 --> 00:04:50.992
a special interest in disability.

00:04:51.042 --> 00:04:52.552
Her papers are really interesting.

00:04:53.052 --> 00:04:56.662
And Tracy, who is my
other supervisor overseas.

00:04:56.672 --> 00:05:00.812
The accessibility services at the
university, I don't know much about

00:05:00.812 --> 00:05:02.442
their experiences with disability.

00:05:02.442 --> 00:05:05.542
I don't know them too well on a
personal level, but I know that

00:05:05.542 --> 00:05:07.362
they've got a very good understanding.

00:05:07.732 --> 00:05:11.672
Very good research in it and
they're really keen to help.

00:05:11.672 --> 00:05:13.482
So that's my battle.

00:05:14.142 --> 00:05:16.602
<v Pam>:That does make such
a difference, doesn't it?

00:05:16.602 --> 00:05:18.692
When you've got really
supportive supervisors.

00:05:19.502 --> 00:05:24.082
And in terms of just the
accessibility of other parts of

00:05:24.082 --> 00:05:28.002
the university, do you find that a
challenge or is it pretty well okay?

00:05:28.852 --> 00:05:29.782
<v Nikita>:Oh, it's a huge challenge.

00:05:30.632 --> 00:05:35.102
I've been quite vocal about it, which
is why I've ended up where I have.

00:05:35.632 --> 00:05:37.622
So I'm an ambulatory wheelchair user.

00:05:37.682 --> 00:05:41.302
I don't know if you have been
to the University of Waikato.

00:05:42.142 --> 00:05:42.532
<v Pam>:No, I haven't.

00:05:42.722 --> 00:05:45.282
<v Nikita>:As much as I love
studying there, I really do.

00:05:45.382 --> 00:05:49.432
I can go on and on about how amazing
the university is to study at.

00:05:49.722 --> 00:05:52.462
The physical campus is a nightmare.

00:05:52.832 --> 00:05:55.652
Everything's on a hill a lot of the time.

00:05:55.702 --> 00:05:58.532
And I'm lucky that my chair is
electric, but for the first half of my

00:05:58.532 --> 00:06:00.272
bachelor's, I was in a manual chair.

00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:09.272
So no, it was a huge challenge to interact
with my peers and to study in person

00:06:09.662 --> 00:06:13.252
purely because if you even got into the
buildings, like all the doors were really

00:06:13.252 --> 00:06:14.872
heavy and I couldn't open them on my own.

00:06:15.252 --> 00:06:19.192
A lot of the lecture theatres were
not set up for a wheelchair user.

00:06:19.232 --> 00:06:20.612
So there were stairs everywhere.

00:06:20.612 --> 00:06:23.862
So I'd have to sit at the front in front
of everyone, kind of like segregated.

00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:27.182
I could feel people staring at me,
which I really didn't appreciate.

00:06:27.702 --> 00:06:30.652
But a lot of the time, the staff
were very courteous, allowed

00:06:30.652 --> 00:06:32.542
me to use lecture recordings.

00:06:32.932 --> 00:06:39.092
So that negated a lot of the negative
in person experiences I found.

00:06:39.892 --> 00:06:42.272
<v Pam>:I'm interested that you
said that people stare at you.

00:06:42.302 --> 00:06:45.242
I'm guessing that most of your
peers are fairly young people

00:06:45.242 --> 00:06:46.752
and you're a young person.

00:06:47.422 --> 00:06:50.792
You hear today that attitudes are
different, that people are different

00:06:50.802 --> 00:06:53.902
because they've been to school
with disabled children, they've

00:06:53.932 --> 00:06:55.582
grown up with disabled children.

00:06:56.122 --> 00:06:56.842
Do you find it?

00:06:57.902 --> 00:07:00.172
<v Nikita>:That's not been
my personal experience.

00:07:00.222 --> 00:07:01.772
I know that it has been for some.

00:07:02.342 --> 00:07:07.532
I think that attitudes surrounding some
disabilities and such as neurodiversity

00:07:07.862 --> 00:07:12.502
and the use of walking sticks and
crutches has definitely changed.

00:07:12.522 --> 00:07:16.212
When I'm using my walking stick
the, there's no surprises there.

00:07:16.212 --> 00:07:20.882
There's no staring But when I use my
chair, yes, there's a lot of judgmental

00:07:20.882 --> 00:07:27.482
looks there is a lot of judgmental, like,
comments and stares especially because

00:07:27.742 --> 00:07:30.642
often when I'm sitting in my chair
studying, I'll cross my legs just because

00:07:30.642 --> 00:07:35.042
it's more comfortable, and the amount of
comments I've had, why are you using  a

00:07:35.052 --> 00:07:39.082
wheelchair, if you can walk, if you can
move your legs, if you can cross them, if

00:07:39.082 --> 00:07:43.902
I stand up briefly to go to the bathroom,
the judgment, don't even get me started

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:48.712
on if I'm parking in a disability park,
and I get out of the car and pull out my

00:07:48.712 --> 00:07:50.862
wheelchair, there's a whole other story.

00:07:51.362 --> 00:07:55.722
To summarize it though, I think the
attitude regarding some mobility

00:07:55.722 --> 00:07:58.282
aids has changed but not quite.

00:07:59.452 --> 00:08:00.372
Not wheelchairs.

00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:04.432
<v Pam>:So there's some pretty rigid
assumptions being made, aren't there?

00:08:04.702 --> 00:08:08.652
I know when I had partial vision, I mean
I'm totally blind now, but when I had

00:08:08.652 --> 00:08:10.802
partial vision it was very difficult.

00:08:10.802 --> 00:08:12.152
It was far more difficult.

00:08:12.582 --> 00:08:17.622
from an attitudinal standpoint, external
attitudinal standpoint, than being

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:21.352
totally blind because although people
don't really understand blindness either.

00:08:21.562 --> 00:08:25.212
In fact, now I keep getting, how
much can you see, which is bizarre

00:08:25.362 --> 00:08:26.682
because I've just told them I'm blind.

00:08:26.692 --> 00:08:31.652
But when you have some vision or
some mobility or whatever it is,

00:08:31.892 --> 00:08:35.102
people just seem to think, oh,
but you should be in this box.

00:08:35.142 --> 00:08:37.102
Why don't you fit in this neat box?

00:08:37.592 --> 00:08:40.092
It really challenges people, doesn't it?

00:08:40.772 --> 00:08:42.052
<v Nikita>:It really does.

00:08:42.102 --> 00:08:47.422
And that's why I quite like talking
about how I have a dynamic disability.

00:08:47.722 --> 00:08:51.082
I came across that term, I can't
exactly remember where, but a couple

00:08:51.082 --> 00:08:55.782
of years ago now, and it's been a game
changer in educating people around me.

00:08:56.112 --> 00:08:59.622
I go, well, some days I can walk,
some days I can use my walking stick

00:08:59.642 --> 00:09:04.502
and other days I am in so much pain
I just cannot cope without my chair.

00:09:04.952 --> 00:09:09.082
And using a term such as dynamic
disability creates a different picture

00:09:09.082 --> 00:09:12.952
in people's minds  sets the scene
a little bit easier So people don't

00:09:12.962 --> 00:09:17.202
think so rigid about boxes and so rigid
about what disability should look like.

00:09:17.492 --> 00:09:18.762
It's got more fluidity

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:19.712
Speaker 2: Right.

00:09:20.102 --> 00:09:25.172
Yeah, i've heard the term before In terms
of people with multiple sclerosis, for

00:09:25.172 --> 00:09:30.042
example And those effects can be very much
the same, being able to maybe move around

00:09:30.062 --> 00:09:32.692
some degree some days and not others, etc.

00:09:32.962 --> 00:09:36.732
And even having good vision one
day and not others, just depending.

00:09:37.242 --> 00:09:41.822
What other barriers have
you dealt with, I guess?

00:09:42.267 --> 00:09:46.207
The major ones that you've dealt with
in your life so far, and I'm really

00:09:46.207 --> 00:09:50.297
interested in terms of supporting
other people as well, and how

00:09:50.297 --> 00:09:54.057
you've managed those and what you
might be able to pass on to others.

00:09:55.402 --> 00:09:58.772
<v Nikita>:I think immediately what
comes to mind is a lot of people

00:09:58.772 --> 00:10:03.482
did not realize in my life that
I was disabled until quite late.

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:05.162
Including my family.

00:10:05.162 --> 00:10:10.212
So, for example, I wasn't diagnosed
with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome until 20.

00:10:10.272 --> 00:10:12.292
Now that's still considered early.

00:10:12.477 --> 00:10:15.897
Within New Zealand statistics and don't
even get me started on that because

00:10:15.897 --> 00:10:17.487
we would never finish this podcast.

00:10:18.817 --> 00:10:23.207
I had been having issues since I was a
very young child with my joints, with

00:10:23.217 --> 00:10:29.207
getting sick constantly with digestive
issues, et cetera mobility issues.

00:10:29.907 --> 00:10:35.827
And it was always just painted as,
oh, they're being a hypochondriac.

00:10:35.877 --> 00:10:36.897
They're being dramatic.

00:10:37.447 --> 00:10:43.847
So, access to medical care, access to
understanding doctors, once my family and

00:10:43.847 --> 00:10:48.447
my friends did believe me became even more
of a challenge because exactly that, the

00:10:48.457 --> 00:10:53.017
stigma and the attitude of, oh, if you're
disabled, you do this, this, and this.

00:10:53.297 --> 00:10:57.297
So, for example, if you're really in that
much pain, you're just sitting in bed,

00:10:57.867 --> 00:10:59.737
doing nothing, feeling sorry for yourself.

00:10:59.987 --> 00:11:01.687
Now, that's not how I was raised.

00:11:02.072 --> 00:11:06.212
I was raised within, for example,
a martial arts setting, where you

00:11:06.212 --> 00:11:07.952
put on a brave face and you push on.

00:11:08.392 --> 00:11:12.182
Now I know that, now, that that is
actually quite dangerous for my body,

00:11:12.212 --> 00:11:18.542
but however, I, as a result, I was not
the stereotypical,  chronic pain person.

00:11:18.802 --> 00:11:20.152
I was doing a bachelor's.

00:11:20.462 --> 00:11:24.442
I was still competing in martial arts
and doing some martial arts workshops.

00:11:24.832 --> 00:11:28.592
I was living quite an active
life with my husband at the time.

00:11:28.982 --> 00:11:33.602
I was socializing with my friends
constantly, traveling to see my family

00:11:33.602 --> 00:11:38.902
in Tobor and Auckland, and I was
living a very full life still, which

00:11:38.902 --> 00:11:43.612
I think Because of the stereotype of
what disability and chronic illness

00:11:43.612 --> 00:11:45.902
looks like, threw a lot of people.

00:11:46.402 --> 00:11:51.292
But also, I've found that
people still have the idea that

00:11:51.292 --> 00:11:52.802
young people can't be disabled.

00:11:53.132 --> 00:11:53.872
Which has been

00:11:53.902 --> 00:11:54.252
<v Pam>:That's very true.

00:11:54.592 --> 00:11:55.032
Yeah.

00:11:55.332 --> 00:11:56.422
<v Nikita>:Which is a challenge.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:00.862
And the best of times Oh,
you can't possibly have that.

00:12:00.862 --> 00:12:03.212
You're so young is a constant comment.

00:12:03.602 --> 00:12:07.802
Also the biggest barrier I have
found is the toxic positivity.

00:12:08.512 --> 00:12:13.202
Now, just so I'm clear, I do
believe in a positive mindset.

00:12:13.722 --> 00:12:20.142
I know that the more that you hyper
focus on your circumstances and the

00:12:20.142 --> 00:12:24.332
negative side of those circumstances,
it creates a negative feedback loop.

00:12:25.042 --> 00:12:26.512
Learnt that in my psych degree.

00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:33.392
However, I also don't believe that being
toxically positive helps anything, either,

00:12:33.692 --> 00:12:35.192
because then you push yourself too far,

00:12:35.682 --> 00:12:38.882
<v Pam>:Explain a bit more about what
you actually mean by toxically

00:12:38.902 --> 00:12:41.412
positive, in detail, if you would?

00:12:41.832 --> 00:12:48.702
<v Nikita>:Yes, so toxic positivity, If
I give an example of, oh, but think of

00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:52.522
the bright side at least you can, for
example, my digestive issues, right?

00:12:52.802 --> 00:12:56.252
I really struggle to
eat meat, for example.

00:12:56.252 --> 00:13:00.192
I used to love steak growing
up and now I just can't do it.

00:13:00.652 --> 00:13:02.332
And people are, oh,
think of the positives.

00:13:02.332 --> 00:13:04.702
At least you get to eat
takeaways whenever you want.

00:13:04.762 --> 00:13:08.742
Not realizing that takeaways
makes me feel really gross because

00:13:08.742 --> 00:13:10.312
of all that heaviness, right?

00:13:10.942 --> 00:13:14.592
Look at the bright side, that you get to
just travel around in a chair whenever you

00:13:14.592 --> 00:13:19.002
want, but society's not set up for me to
travel around in a chair whenever I want.

00:13:19.692 --> 00:13:23.872
Oh, look on the bright side, at least
your walking stick matches your outfits.

00:13:24.042 --> 00:13:26.842
Yeah, but I would rather not
need this in the first place.

00:13:27.392 --> 00:13:28.842
<v Pam>:But it's just such fun.

00:13:29.062 --> 00:13:30.202
It is bizarre, isn't it?

00:13:30.222 --> 00:13:34.592
And yes, I must admit, I've also
come across that, and I totally

00:13:34.642 --> 00:13:36.022
taitoko what you're saying.

00:13:36.262 --> 00:13:39.222
I think that you, me, and Stella
Young could have had some very

00:13:39.222 --> 00:13:40.652
interesting conversations.

00:13:41.652 --> 00:13:44.232
Have you seen the video that Stella does?

00:13:44.332 --> 00:13:45.672
I'm Not Your Inspiration.

00:13:45.672 --> 00:13:46.702
Thank you very much.

00:13:47.132 --> 00:13:47.602
Seen that?

00:13:48.022 --> 00:13:48.052
<v Nikita>:Yes.

00:13:48.362 --> 00:13:49.247
<v Pam>:That's awesome, isn't it?

00:13:49.747 --> 00:13:52.577
<v Nikita>:I loved it and I
very much live by that.

00:13:52.617 --> 00:13:54.397
Oh, you're an inspiration for all you do.

00:13:54.857 --> 00:13:56.827
No, I'm just trying to live my life.

00:13:56.837 --> 00:13:58.397
Can you just back up a bit?

00:13:58.397 --> 00:14:01.707
Speaker 2: You talked about when
you were younger and that you

00:14:01.717 --> 00:14:04.903
knew that there were some issues
for you in terms of impairment.

00:14:04.903 --> 00:14:06.887
How did you feel?

00:14:07.367 --> 00:14:08.957
Like, I'm really interested.

00:14:08.977 --> 00:14:16.832
You said that nobody really realized until
you were 20 and that, It kind of, it felt

00:14:16.942 --> 00:14:21.712
odd, and I'm interested because just a bit
of personal disclosure, I was always told

00:14:21.712 --> 00:14:25.312
that my sight would never get any worse,
and so when it started getting worse when

00:14:25.312 --> 00:14:27.782
I was a teenager, it was really difficult.

00:14:27.782 --> 00:14:32.782
So I'm wondering for you, what was
teenagehood like with that overlay?

00:14:34.232 --> 00:14:36.912
<v Nikita>:I spent a lot of my
teenage life being in denial.

00:14:38.292 --> 00:14:41.132
I think so exactly that I was undiagnosed.

00:14:41.612 --> 00:14:44.592
I was that kid in school that
had the constant knee issues.

00:14:44.632 --> 00:14:47.932
So it was constantly in
braces or on crutches kind

00:14:47.932 --> 00:14:49.502
of expected to joke about it.

00:14:49.512 --> 00:14:54.312
So I had to be really lighthearted about
the fact that, oh, I was constantly

00:14:54.312 --> 00:14:57.422
in pain or, oh, my kneecap would
just slip out whenever it wanted.

00:14:59.162 --> 00:14:59.802
<v Pam>:That's horrible.

00:14:59.802 --> 00:15:01.742
That's toxic positivity, isn't it?

00:15:02.372 --> 00:15:02.762
<v Nikita>:Yeah.

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:06.812
Constantly expected to be upbeat,
look at the positives and oh, you

00:15:06.812 --> 00:15:09.732
know, everything will be fine being
the butt of people's joke about it.

00:15:10.382 --> 00:15:14.112
And I was very much in denial
because everyone around me

00:15:14.112 --> 00:15:15.412
was not taking it seriously.

00:15:15.452 --> 00:15:16.662
I wouldn't take it seriously.

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:18.922
So I can't pretend that
anything's wrong here.

00:15:19.112 --> 00:15:23.882
I can't acknowledge what's going
on when deep down I knew, I knew

00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:26.632
something wasn't right at all.

00:15:27.222 --> 00:15:30.122
Not just with my joints, but I
would get fatigued a lot quicker.

00:15:30.122 --> 00:15:34.192
As I said, my digestive issues,
I dealt with really bad insomnia

00:15:34.222 --> 00:15:35.752
as a result of chronic pain.

00:15:35.752 --> 00:15:38.772
I was fainting a lot in
my teenage years as well.

00:15:39.592 --> 00:15:42.452
So I would, for example, go and
have a hot shower and then I would

00:15:42.452 --> 00:15:44.962
pass out, hit my head constantly.

00:15:46.722 --> 00:15:51.172
<v Pam>:How did you manage discussing
that with your parents when you

00:15:51.172 --> 00:15:52.752
really knew, but didn't want to know?

00:15:52.852 --> 00:15:54.212
And boy, do I know what that's like.

00:15:54.452 --> 00:15:56.432
How did you manage that with your parents?

00:15:57.772 --> 00:15:58.282
<v Nikita>:I won't lie.

00:15:58.282 --> 00:16:00.022
It was difficult for a few years.

00:16:00.072 --> 00:16:02.952
My mother was very much
more understanding.

00:16:03.422 --> 00:16:07.762
She was still kind of in denial for
herself, but that turns out it's

00:16:07.762 --> 00:16:10.502
because she experienced the same
things and has the same condition.

00:16:10.962 --> 00:16:11.892
Just milder.

00:16:13.572 --> 00:16:19.222
My father I don't think my father
really knew much about it, to be honest

00:16:19.272 --> 00:16:21.442
because he was constantly at work.

00:16:21.442 --> 00:16:26.052
He was basically the sole breadwinner
through my teenage years, because my mum

00:16:26.052 --> 00:16:28.972
was taking me to doctor's appointments,
trying to get my knee stabilised,

00:16:29.012 --> 00:16:32.402
because at the time we just thought,
Oh, if we fix the knee, it's a martial

00:16:32.402 --> 00:16:34.292
arts injury, everything will be fine.

00:16:36.442 --> 00:16:37.542
Newsflash, but not.

00:16:37.752 --> 00:16:37.912
But

00:16:39.892 --> 00:16:43.892
My parents did their best to support
me, but there was also contention

00:16:43.892 --> 00:16:49.462
because I would for example, I had
a fall and I thought Oh, I'm pretty

00:16:49.462 --> 00:16:50.732
sure I've dislocated my shoulder.

00:16:51.442 --> 00:16:54.372
And my parents were like, no,
no, no, you can't have done that.

00:16:54.372 --> 00:16:55.212
Don't be dramatic.

00:16:55.592 --> 00:17:00.632
I get to school and my shoulder had
ballooned to the point where we actually

00:17:00.632 --> 00:17:04.132
had to cut my bra strap to get my bra off.

00:17:04.192 --> 00:17:04.912
We couldn't move.

00:17:05.572 --> 00:17:07.372
And it had turned out that
I had popped my shoulder.

00:17:08.122 --> 00:17:15.057
So it was all to say it was a a debate
quite a lot through my teenage years.

00:17:15.557 --> 00:17:19.077
I had very supportive family because
they knew something was wrong, but it was

00:17:19.077 --> 00:17:20.997
to the degree that something was wrong.

00:17:21.477 --> 00:17:24.887
They kind of expected everything to
kind of stabilize and get better,

00:17:25.287 --> 00:17:26.977
which just wasn't what happened.

00:17:27.827 --> 00:17:30.607
<v Pam>:So what would you, what
would you tell your teenage self

00:17:30.677 --> 00:17:32.797
now if you had the opportunity?

00:17:32.807 --> 00:17:38.297
In other words, I guess what I'm
asking you to do is to share insights

00:17:38.517 --> 00:17:44.037
and tips to others who might, at this
very minute, have similar issues.

00:17:45.817 --> 00:17:49.897
<v Nikita>:I would tell myself in my
teenage years that your new motto to

00:17:49.897 --> 00:17:52.767
life is to live life through adaption.

00:17:53.582 --> 00:17:57.142
So I choose to live my
life to the fullest extent.

00:17:57.212 --> 00:18:00.792
I just have to adapt it in
different ways than other people.

00:18:01.232 --> 00:18:05.602
And that by forcing yourself to try
and do everything in the same way that

00:18:05.602 --> 00:18:10.132
everyone else is doing things, you're
only going to cause yourself more pain.

00:18:10.432 --> 00:18:13.672
And you're also only going to feel
more grief when you realize you

00:18:13.672 --> 00:18:15.392
can't do what your peers are doing.

00:18:15.842 --> 00:18:17.012
So adapt what you're doing.

00:18:17.102 --> 00:18:18.112
There's no shame in it.

00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:23.532
And there's no shame in
arguing that something's wrong.

00:18:23.992 --> 00:18:28.212
It's okay to advocate for yourself
in that sense and get yourself

00:18:28.212 --> 00:18:29.252
the supports that you need.

00:18:31.302 --> 00:18:32.672
<v Pam>:Excellent, great advice.

00:18:33.062 --> 00:18:39.382
And do you find now that you helping
others with advocacy as well as yourself?

00:18:40.042 --> 00:18:45.982
<v Nikita>:Yes I have been able to support
multiple people to get diagnosed

00:18:45.982 --> 00:18:48.922
with the same condition that I do
because they were bringing up their

00:18:48.922 --> 00:18:53.582
own experiences and I went, look, full
disclosure, I'm no doctor, but this

00:18:53.582 --> 00:18:55.622
is something I experienced as a kid.

00:18:55.722 --> 00:18:58.872
And if you really are worried, I
encourage you to speak to your doctor.

00:18:59.392 --> 00:19:03.902
And for, I think it's about six of
my friends now, it's turned out that

00:19:03.902 --> 00:19:07.762
they've had the same condition that I
do once they went and saw specialists.

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:12.832
So, I've been able to advocate for
people to not only get diagnosis,

00:19:13.292 --> 00:19:17.942
but within, for example, NDSA, the
National Disabled Students Association,

00:19:18.262 --> 00:19:22.542
I've been able to help people get
reasonable accommodations and supports

00:19:22.542 --> 00:19:24.312
to help them continue with their study.

00:19:25.432 --> 00:19:26.112
<v Pam>:Fantastic.

00:19:26.152 --> 00:19:26.872
That's great.

00:19:27.162 --> 00:19:29.952
And speaking of study and
going back to your masters.

00:19:30.522 --> 00:19:34.462
What are you looking to achieve
once you finish that degree?

00:19:35.532 --> 00:19:39.572
<v Nikita>:Oh, when I've finished my Masters,
the study doesn't end, I want to do a PhD.

00:19:40.582 --> 00:19:42.722
<v Pam>:I don't have to worry about
that, I've just finished mine.

00:19:44.772 --> 00:19:50.552
<v Nikita>:I want to create a framework for
youth with rare disorders, particularly

00:19:50.552 --> 00:19:56.372
Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, to I want to
be able to study through school from

00:19:56.372 --> 00:19:58.492
primary all the way up to tertiary.

00:19:58.772 --> 00:20:01.882
And I know that that's a big ask,
but I, that's what I want to do.

00:20:02.312 --> 00:20:06.862
Because I know that in high school,
if I, in particular, if I had known

00:20:06.862 --> 00:20:12.012
that I had a rare disorder, I would
have appreciated being able to have a

00:20:12.022 --> 00:20:16.442
framework to go to my teachers and to
who else was supporting me at the time

00:20:16.442 --> 00:20:18.812
and going, okay, this is what I need.

00:20:18.862 --> 00:20:20.342
I need to be able to study hybrid.

00:20:20.372 --> 00:20:24.322
I need to be able to have this
accommodation for my classes or

00:20:24.352 --> 00:20:27.052
I'm on this medication, which means
that the side effects are going to

00:20:27.052 --> 00:20:29.782
affect me at this period of the day.

00:20:29.782 --> 00:20:33.872
So I need accommodations for this
being able to plan things adequately.

00:20:33.872 --> 00:20:36.342
And that's what I want
to use my PhD to do.

00:20:36.537 --> 00:20:39.707
<v Pam>:I'm wondering about maybe
working for the Ministry of

00:20:39.707 --> 00:20:41.277
Education or something like that.

00:20:43.097 --> 00:20:47.977
<v Nikita>:Basically anywhere that I can do
disability research I want my PhD to be in

00:20:48.237 --> 00:20:54.337
exactly that, the creation of a, Framework
for rare disorders within education, but

00:20:54.337 --> 00:21:00.847
I want to do all sorts of research and in
regards to disability I want to look at

00:21:00.887 --> 00:21:05.847
neurodivergence and its correlation with
multiple different types of disability.

00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:10.607
I want to create disability policy
within workplaces to make workplaces

00:21:10.607 --> 00:21:13.267
more accessible, disability action plans.

00:21:13.297 --> 00:21:16.987
I'm hugely passionate about disability
action plans If you were asking

00:21:16.987 --> 00:21:18.977
me, Everywhere should have them.

00:21:19.247 --> 00:21:23.807
Tertiary institutes, high schools,
primary schools, workplaces,

00:21:24.017 --> 00:21:27.297
government organizations, everywhere
should have disability action plans.

00:21:27.297 --> 00:21:28.027
I love them.

00:21:28.027 --> 00:21:30.597
<v Pam>:You're a true force of nature.

00:21:31.427 --> 00:21:35.427
I feel tired just listening to you,
but yeah, I think that it sounds

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:38.867
as if you're going to have a great
future in research and advocacy.

00:21:39.772 --> 00:21:40.462
<v Nikita>:Thank you.

00:21:40.712 --> 00:21:41.112
Yeah.

00:21:41.122 --> 00:21:41.182
Thank you.

00:21:41.992 --> 00:21:42.912
<v Pam>:Sounds wonderful.

00:21:44.052 --> 00:21:47.502
What other things do you want
for your life and to be able

00:21:47.502 --> 00:21:49.152
to maybe work with others?

00:21:50.372 --> 00:21:51.912
<v Nikita>:There's a lot to be honest.

00:21:52.222 --> 00:21:57.032
So I'm currently public speaking for
a couple of different organisations,

00:21:57.062 --> 00:22:02.442
I guest lecture for a couple of
different universities as well, on

00:22:02.462 --> 00:22:06.742
leadership, disability within education
particularly at the university of

00:22:06.772 --> 00:22:11.302
Waikato, I guess, lecture for one of
their courses on supporting teachers

00:22:11.302 --> 00:22:16.022
to teach disabled students and the
experiences of disabled students.

00:22:16.532 --> 00:22:17.802
So I want to continue that.

00:22:18.222 --> 00:22:20.262
I want to continue public speaking.

00:22:20.302 --> 00:22:23.372
I want to continue working
with disability organizations.

00:22:23.822 --> 00:22:30.442
I do want to set up a dojo at some point
where I can teach adaptive martial arts.

00:22:30.867 --> 00:22:32.207
From a base.

00:22:32.407 --> 00:22:33.477
<v Pam>:What a great idea.

00:22:34.377 --> 00:22:38.187
Yeah, and would that include
people with other impairments?

00:22:38.227 --> 00:22:41.717
Would you be interested in teaching
blind people say for example?

00:22:41.767 --> 00:22:45.097
<v Nikita>:One of the best martial
artists that I ever met at

00:22:45.097 --> 00:22:47.167
my dojo was a blind woman.

00:22:47.537 --> 00:22:47.897
<v Pam>:Mm hmm.

00:22:48.387 --> 00:22:53.847
<v Nikita>:And I asked how she was
able to do her form work so clearly.

00:22:54.077 --> 00:22:56.257
And when I say that it was beautiful.

00:22:56.277 --> 00:22:56.947
It was immaculate.

00:22:56.947 --> 00:22:59.787
Her hands and her arms would
always be in the correct place.

00:23:00.437 --> 00:23:02.477
And She was like, I can feel it.

00:23:02.507 --> 00:23:04.587
I can feel the floor.

00:23:04.587 --> 00:23:06.527
I can feel where everything needs to be.

00:23:06.887 --> 00:23:10.137
So I want to support all impairments
to be able to do martial arts.

00:23:10.157 --> 00:23:15.347
I recognize that I can't remember the
specific statistics, but I did read

00:23:15.427 --> 00:23:19.427
that disabled people are more likely to
experience violence, whether it's bullying

00:23:19.497 --> 00:23:20.757
or whether it's domestic violence.

00:23:22.027 --> 00:23:25.167
And I want to be able to support
disabled people to defend themselves.

00:23:25.227 --> 00:23:29.847
And I very much believe in Shaolin
Kenpo being one of the best,

00:23:29.877 --> 00:23:31.337
and I will die on that hill.

00:23:31.517 --> 00:23:32.977
But I want to support everyone.

00:23:32.977 --> 00:23:36.677
So for example, my brother who is
autistic, he used to train with me.

00:23:37.167 --> 00:23:37.982
I do want to support disabled people.

00:23:38.052 --> 00:23:39.012
Blind people to train.

00:23:39.012 --> 00:23:40.812
I want to support people
in wheelchairs to train.

00:23:40.812 --> 00:23:43.732
I want to support those with
intellectual disabilities to train.

00:23:44.012 --> 00:23:45.752
I want to support deaf people to train.

00:23:46.912 --> 00:23:47.542
<v Pam>:Everyone.

00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:49.632
I want it to be a career in itself.

00:23:49.812 --> 00:23:52.652
So it sounds to me like
you're into multiple careers.

00:23:52.702 --> 00:23:55.492
<v Nikita>:To be honest, none of my
family members, even in their own

00:23:55.492 --> 00:24:00.032
careers, have ever  understood the
word relax or retirement or holiday.

00:24:01.442 --> 00:24:04.307
<v Pam>:Yeah, I don't use the R
word for retirement either, even

00:24:04.307 --> 00:24:08.281
though I am between you and I
over 65, but retire, what's that?

00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:14.761
Think for some disabled people it takes
us quite some time to establish ourselves

00:24:14.791 --> 00:24:20.881
as professionals or in whatever avenue
that we want to work in, whether it's

00:24:20.891 --> 00:24:27.121
voluntarily or in a paid capacity, that
we don't necessarily have an end date.

00:24:28.311 --> 00:24:29.501
<v Nikita>:I completely agree with you.

00:24:29.561 --> 00:24:32.471
It takes so much longer
for us to get established.

00:24:32.481 --> 00:24:33.731
Sorry for my constant moving.

00:24:33.731 --> 00:24:35.721
My legs get pretty sore pretty quickly.

00:24:36.231 --> 00:24:40.831
I think it takes so much longer for us
to get established within employment

00:24:40.861 --> 00:24:45.316
and within a career compared to non
disabled people, especially when

00:24:45.316 --> 00:24:46.466
we're trying to do what we love.

00:24:46.866 --> 00:24:49.986
And the disability sector, of
which I want to go into, is

00:24:49.986 --> 00:24:53.456
notoriously hard to get into, even
though you're a disabled person.

00:24:53.486 --> 00:24:55.596
It's, I have feelings there.

00:24:56.446 --> 00:24:59.266
<v Pam>:I'd really like to hear those
feelings, if you're prepared to share.

00:25:00.131 --> 00:25:00.721
<v Nikita>:I am.

00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:03.721
A little bit of context,  I'm quite
blunt, which sometimes gets me in

00:25:03.721 --> 00:25:06.261
a bit of trouble, but it works.

00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:09.001
I don't think there's enough
disabled people in leadership.

00:25:10.031 --> 00:25:13.711
I think we're consulted on
quite often in a lot of spaces.

00:25:13.711 --> 00:25:16.251
And don't get me wrong, we could
be consulted a lot more than we

00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:19.991
are, but often we're consulted
with, and we're not leading.

00:25:20.741 --> 00:25:21.701
And we should be leading.

00:25:21.731 --> 00:25:26.211
And I also think within the disability
sector, certain disabilities

00:25:27.001 --> 00:25:30.371
are ranked is the wrong word.

00:25:30.931 --> 00:25:33.011
I don't know what word
I would use, though.

00:25:33.621 --> 00:25:39.321
For example, if I use my experience
I struggle to find paid employment

00:25:40.091 --> 00:25:41.661
because I use a wheelchair.

00:25:42.661 --> 00:25:48.391
Whereas my brother has perhaps not
struggled so much because a lot of people

00:25:48.391 --> 00:25:52.721
find, at least in his experience, I know
this is not everyone's experience, but

00:25:52.721 --> 00:25:57.641
in his experience, Autistic people are
easier to support within the workplace

00:25:57.681 --> 00:26:00.361
than say, somebody who uses a wheelchair.

00:26:00.961 --> 00:26:03.931
<v Pam>:If I can be crass, they
look normal compared to us.

00:26:04.741 --> 00:26:05.181
<v Nikita>:Yes.

00:26:05.881 --> 00:26:08.961
<v Pam>:Because we use guide dogs,
wheelchairs, white canes, whatever.

00:26:10.601 --> 00:26:13.584
<v Nikita>:And so I feel  like
ranking's the wrong word, perhaps,

00:26:13.994 --> 00:26:15.534
but I'm not sure quite what else

00:26:15.534 --> 00:26:16.844
<v Pam>:it's a kind of hierarchy, isn't it?

00:26:17.234 --> 00:26:17.534
Yeah.

00:26:18.384 --> 00:26:22.794
<v Nikita>:So I believe that there
needs to be more representation

00:26:23.024 --> 00:26:25.704
of different types of disabilities
within the disability sector.

00:26:26.224 --> 00:26:30.124
I believe that there needs to be
more disabled people in leadership.

00:26:30.444 --> 00:26:35.134
If it boils down to it, we need more
disabled people in leadership, rather

00:26:35.134 --> 00:26:38.904
than just being consulted with, we need
to be the ones leading the charge, and

00:26:38.904 --> 00:26:40.774
we are more than capable of doing so.

00:26:43.054 --> 00:26:46.154
<v Pam>:That was actually the whole
thrust of my PhD thesis, so

00:26:46.154 --> 00:26:47.424
I'll have to send you a copy.

00:26:48.704 --> 00:26:51.134
And yeah, I couldn't agree more.

00:26:51.174 --> 00:26:55.684
I think that leadership and management
is extremely important and I mean, I

00:26:55.684 --> 00:26:59.244
suppose if you think about it, every
other group in society that you can

00:26:59.244 --> 00:27:03.654
think of is led and managed by its
own members, which is as it should be.

00:27:04.254 --> 00:27:08.094
And probably the disability
sector is the only one that's not.

00:27:08.914 --> 00:27:10.254
<v Nikita>:I completely
agree with you though.

00:27:10.904 --> 00:27:14.304
I will just keep echoing it, there's
not enough disabled people in

00:27:14.304 --> 00:27:16.054
leadership and I couldn't tell you why.

00:27:16.324 --> 00:27:22.494
I really couldn't tell you why, other
than maybe for some places it's easier

00:27:22.574 --> 00:27:26.534
for example, to not hire wheelchair
users because accessibility, trying

00:27:26.534 --> 00:27:28.314
to fix that is a whole nightmare.

00:27:28.874 --> 00:27:30.414
Which doesn't make it fair.

00:27:30.414 --> 00:27:30.474
Yeah.

00:27:30.654 --> 00:27:35.524
And I know life's not fair, but that's, I
get very upset and angry about it, to be

00:27:35.524 --> 00:27:41.204
honest because I watch other incredible
leaders, forget myself for a sec, I watch

00:27:41.254 --> 00:27:46.714
other incredible leaders struggle to
find work because their disabilities are

00:27:46.714 --> 00:27:53.129
dynamic and change, for example, they're
not, Staple, the same, constant, that

00:27:53.219 --> 00:27:57.489
some days they will be fine, other days
they will be in hospital, other days they

00:27:57.489 --> 00:28:01.399
need a chair, some days they can need
no mobility aid, and they struggle to

00:28:01.399 --> 00:28:06.459
find work, but they are some of the most
dedicated, passionate, smart, empathetic

00:28:06.459 --> 00:28:10.739
people I have ever met in my life, and
they struggle to get work just because

00:28:10.759 --> 00:28:14.229
their disability is, is what it is.

00:28:14.564 --> 00:28:14.954
<v Pam>:Yeah.

00:28:15.494 --> 00:28:19.514
And so it tells us, I think, that
there needs to be more universality

00:28:19.524 --> 00:28:23.974
in the design of not only the built
environment, but also in workplaces

00:28:24.014 --> 00:28:29.334
and in the way we think about people
and the way that we accommodate people

00:28:29.654 --> 00:28:34.644
and the recognition that we share such
a lot, but we have our differences

00:28:34.664 --> 00:28:37.334
and those things enrich all of us.

00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:44.769
<v Nikita>:I am a huge believer that
there needs to be some sense of

00:28:44.769 --> 00:28:50.189
compulsory education within the
workplace on, at minimum, the social

00:28:50.199 --> 00:28:54.969
model of disability, but preferably
the human rights model of disability.

00:28:55.619 --> 00:28:57.419
Because I think that would change
a lot of things, to be honest.

00:28:57.419 --> 00:28:58.099
<v Pam>:I agree.

00:28:58.099 --> 00:28:59.549
I think it would be very helpful.

00:28:59.609 --> 00:29:04.779
And that's an area that I work in, but
it's very hard to convince people that

00:29:04.779 --> 00:29:08.939
they need something they didn't know they
wanted or they didn't know they needed.

00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:12.729
Once they've had the training,
then they recognize they needed it.

00:29:12.839 --> 00:29:17.169
But it's getting your foot in the
door, as with so many other things.

00:29:17.629 --> 00:29:23.179
<v Nikita>:I want to say, a lot of disabled
leaders that I've met get discouraged

00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:27.349
because they feel like they're not
disabled enough, or they're not

00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:33.409
disabled in a certain way, or they're
not eloquent enough that's not true.

00:29:33.729 --> 00:29:34.684
That is not true.

00:29:35.134 --> 00:29:39.814
I personally got to where I am, and
I believe this with every fibre of

00:29:39.834 --> 00:29:45.194
my being, because I just wouldn't
shut up, and I called it as it is.

00:29:45.244 --> 00:29:51.684
I didn't use any fancy language, I
didn't use any particular tone, I just

00:29:51.694 --> 00:29:56.824
wouldn't shut up, and I kept going with
my passion, and when one door shut, I

00:29:56.824 --> 00:29:58.364
looked for another door that was open.

00:29:58.934 --> 00:30:02.414
You don't have to be a
certain image of disabled.

00:30:03.174 --> 00:30:06.504
You don't have to be pleasing on
the ear to listen to in that sense,

00:30:06.554 --> 00:30:08.674
tone wise or using fancy language.

00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:13.594
Passion is enough and if you
keep pushing, doors will open.

00:30:14.064 --> 00:30:17.754
Three years ago, I wouldn't think that
I'm speaking to you about my experience.

00:30:17.754 --> 00:30:21.514
I wouldn't think that I would be
guest lecturing for unis or having

00:30:21.514 --> 00:30:27.344
had done a workshop with the United
Nations sector, which is called

00:30:27.344 --> 00:30:29.784
UNESCO on rare disorders in education.

00:30:30.094 --> 00:30:32.964
Oh, I would have laughed in your
face if you had told me that.

00:30:33.974 --> 00:30:36.624
But I kept yelling and
that's how I got here.

00:30:37.034 --> 00:30:38.884
<v Pam>:Yeah, so don't just
knock on those doors.

00:30:38.894 --> 00:30:39.814
Hammer on them.

00:30:39.944 --> 00:30:43.164
Absolutely insist that they be
open, is what I'm hearing from you.

00:30:43.464 --> 00:30:46.004
<v Nikita>:Take a sledgehammer
and sledge through that door.

00:30:48.174 --> 00:30:50.004
<v Pam>:Nikita, you're such
a breath of fresh air.

00:30:50.004 --> 00:30:53.744
It's been wonderful speaking to
you today and I want to wish you

00:30:53.814 --> 00:30:57.384
all the very, very best for the
future in everything that you do.

00:30:57.924 --> 00:31:02.044
I'm absolutely sure that we'll keep
hearing your name again and again.

00:31:02.224 --> 00:31:04.734
And I hope our paths continue to cross.

00:31:04.734 --> 00:31:05.864
Thank you so much.

00:31:06.904 --> 00:31:07.834
<v Nikita>:I hope so, too.

00:31:08.224 --> 00:31:10.104
Thank you so much for this opportunity

00:31:16.034 --> 00:31:17.764
<v Bill>:Are you a disabled disrupter?

00:31:18.444 --> 00:31:22.114
Have you worked in sectors where a few
other disabled people are employed?

00:31:22.844 --> 00:31:24.594
Do you have unusual hobbies?

00:31:25.304 --> 00:31:28.124
Have you undertaken travel
to exotic locations?

00:31:28.804 --> 00:31:31.014
If so, we'd love to hear from you.

00:31:31.734 --> 00:31:38.774
Send an email or voicemail
message to disrupters@drnz.co.nz.

00:31:39.114 --> 00:31:39.914
Who knows?

00:31:40.134 --> 00:31:43.714
Your contribution could be
selected for broadcast on a future

00:31:43.734 --> 00:31:46.134
disability disrupters podcast.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.220
<v Pam>:And that's a wrap for
this month's edition of the

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.780
Disability Disrupters podcast.
