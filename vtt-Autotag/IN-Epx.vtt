WEBVTT

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.679
<v Expert1> Let's engage with
disabled people about what

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:05.000
we are going to do for them.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.850
<v Expert2> We must remember to ensure
everyone is consulted, including a

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.810
small percentage of disabled people.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.000
It's fine for others to
speak on their behalf.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.630
<v Jonathan> No, way, let's
disrupt the disability discourse.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.119
It's the Disability
Disrupters Podcast with Dr.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.020
Pam MacNeill.

00:00:21.173 --> 00:00:25.163
<v Dr Pam> Hi everyone, and welcome
to another episode of Disability

00:00:25.163 --> 00:00:30.683
Disruptors, the show that disrupts
people's expectations of disabled

00:00:30.683 --> 00:00:32.333
people, which are often extremely low.

00:00:33.743 --> 00:00:40.883
Today I'm joined by Nikita Van Dijk,
and I want to pass on my congratulations

00:00:40.883 --> 00:00:46.593
to Nikita, who has recently been
selected as one of the members of the

00:00:46.593 --> 00:00:52.053
refresh group looking at refreshing
the New Zealand disability strategy.

00:00:52.353 --> 00:00:59.118
Also, in this program, there is a segment
of   a recent presentation that I gave

00:00:59.508 --> 00:01:05.448
to a webinar called Korero for Change,
and this is just a few minutes long.

00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:09.648
I'm going to include that here as
well to get a conversation started

00:01:09.948 --> 00:01:14.148
about employment of disabled
people in the disability sector.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Bill> Disability Disrupters is
proudly brought to you by Disability

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.660
Responsiveness New Zealand.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.110
At DRNZ, we produce and facilitate
workshops for non disabled people to

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.300
learn about how they can respond well
to the rights and needs of the one in

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.160
four people who experience disability.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.990
We also develop and facilitate workshops
and mentoring programs for disabled

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.460
people so they can build a great life.

00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:40.806
<v Dr Pam> I'm joined
today by Nikita Van Dijk.

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:41.556
Hi Nikita.

00:01:41.556 --> 00:01:43.706
<v Nikita> Kia ora, how are you?

00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:46.646
<v Dr Pam> Good, it's really
great to have you on the show.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:52.421
<v Nikita> Well, hi I'm Nikita, or
some people call me Nikki Van Dijk.

00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:54.911
I am disabled complexly.

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:59.551
So I have several chronic illnesses,
including Ehlers Danlos Syndrome

00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:01.421
and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.

00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:03.101
I'm also neurodiverse.

00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:08.151
I'm a Master's student at the
University of Waikato undertaking

00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:11.751
a Master's in Disability and
Inclusion Studies, following a

00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:15.296
Bachelor's of arts and psychology.

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:16.806
I'm in Whangarei.

00:02:17.306 --> 00:02:18.186
I love music.

00:02:18.246 --> 00:02:19.096
I love reading.

00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:20.956
I'm a little bit of a nerd as well.

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:24.696
And I also have a big passion for
martial arts and self defense.

00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:30.746
I did Shaolin Kenpo competitively
for about 15 years and I

00:02:30.746 --> 00:02:34.056
still train personally as a
bit of a outlet for myself.

00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:36.716
<v Dr Pam> And in your
spare time, you breathe.

00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:38.381
<v Nikita> Yeah, basically.

00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:40.021
Breathe and sleep.

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.351
<v Dr Pam> Doesn't sound like
you've got much spare time at all.

00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:44.141
Gosh.

00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:45.831
<v Nikita> But I love it that way.

00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:48.761
<v Dr Pam> I'm really interested
in what you're talking about

00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:51.371
in terms of your martial arts.

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:54.731
I guess you do that too to keep
fit, don't you, now that you're not

00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:56.521
so much into the competitive side?

00:02:57.231 --> 00:02:58.301
<v Nikita> I do, yeah.

00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:02.191
<v Dr Pam> And you go to university,
you're doing a master's degree.

00:03:02.221 --> 00:03:06.431
Gosh I'm sure you and I could just do
an interview on going to university

00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:12.006
and  the complexities of that, but how
are you finding it as a disabled woman?

00:03:12.856 --> 00:03:15.566
<v Nikita> I am finding it, I
won't lie, it's quite challenging.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:20.096
I'm quite lucky enough that my
master's programme is entirely hybrid.

00:03:20.656 --> 00:03:25.026
So I can study from home or if I
am in hospital or I need to travel

00:03:25.076 --> 00:03:26.716
for work, I can study anywhere.

00:03:27.246 --> 00:03:31.056
And then just to see my supervisors
on campus as needed but there's

00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:32.216
still its own challenges.

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:37.296
A lot of tertiary institutes are
not set up properly for hybrid

00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:38.606
learning or online learning.

00:03:38.936 --> 00:03:41.656
A lot of staff don't
understand dynamic disability.

00:03:41.686 --> 00:03:45.046
I'm lucky that my supervisors
do, but throughout my educational

00:03:45.046 --> 00:03:45.836
journey, a lot of them don't.

00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:49.936
Which has created its own challenges,
but it's also quite isolating studying

00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:53.866
hybrid as a disabled person who's
already quite isolated from society.

00:03:54.286 --> 00:03:54.776
So,

00:03:55.586 --> 00:03:58.656
<v Dr Pam> yeah, I studied isolated
because it was through COVID.

00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:03.036
And I had actually just finished all
my research interviews with people,

00:04:03.046 --> 00:04:07.416
fortunately, and most of them actually had
been done over the phone or zoom anyway.

00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:11.406
But, it was during lockdown
that I actually started writing.

00:04:11.706 --> 00:04:16.086
So it kind of worked out okay for me,
but it is quite isolating, you're right.

00:04:16.126 --> 00:04:19.906
And I stopped going up to
Massey for my meetings and

00:04:19.906 --> 00:04:21.476
things, which I really missed.

00:04:21.756 --> 00:04:24.596
There's nothing like being in the
same room with your supervisors.

00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:26.431
<v Nikita> No, there's not.

00:04:26.481 --> 00:04:29.051
And I love my supervisors dearly.

00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:34.121
They not only challenge me, but they're so
empathetic and they're so understanding.

00:04:34.671 --> 00:04:38.191
And they're really kind people and
quite interesting to talk to as well.

00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:41.101
<v Dr Pam> Are they
disabled people themselves?

00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:43.611
<v Nikita> I'm not 100 percent sure.

00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:47.961
I know one of them, Katrina,
studies inclusion with a bit of

00:04:47.961 --> 00:04:50.341
a special interest in disability.

00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:51.901
Her papers are really interesting.

00:04:52.401 --> 00:04:56.011
And Tracy, who is my
other supervisor overseas.

00:04:56.021 --> 00:05:00.161
The accessibility services at the
university, I don't know much about

00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:01.791
their experiences with disability.

00:05:01.791 --> 00:05:04.891
I don't know them too well on a
personal level, but I know that

00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:06.711
they've got a very good understanding.

00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:11.021
Very good research in it and
they're really keen to help.

00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:12.831
So that's my battle.

00:05:13.491 --> 00:05:15.951
<v Dr Pam> That does make
such a difference, doesn't it?

00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:18.041
When you've got really
supportive supervisors.

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:23.431
And in terms of just the
accessibility of other parts of

00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:27.351
the university, do you find that a
challenge or is it pretty well okay?

00:05:28.201 --> 00:05:29.131
<v Nikita> Oh, it's a huge challenge.

00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:34.451
I've been quite vocal about it, which
is why I've ended up where I have.

00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:36.971
So I'm an ambulatory wheelchair user.

00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:40.651
I don't know if you have been
to the University of Waikato.

00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:41.881
<v Dr Pam> No, I haven't.

00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:44.631
<v Nikita> As much as I love
studying there, I really do.

00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:48.781
I can go on and on about how amazing
the university is to study at.

00:05:49.071 --> 00:05:51.811
The physical campus is a nightmare.

00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:55.001
Everything's on a hill a lot of the time.

00:05:55.051 --> 00:05:57.881
And I'm lucky that my chair is
electric, but for the first half of my

00:05:57.881 --> 00:05:59.621
bachelor's, I was in a manual chair.

00:06:01.001 --> 00:06:08.621
So no, it was a huge challenge to interact
with my peers and to study in person

00:06:09.011 --> 00:06:12.601
purely because if you even got into the
buildings, like all the doors were really

00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:14.221
heavy and I couldn't open them on my own.

00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:18.541
A lot of the lecture theatres were
not set up for a wheelchair user.

00:06:18.581 --> 00:06:19.961
So there were stairs everywhere.

00:06:19.961 --> 00:06:23.211
So I'd have to sit at the front in front
of everyone, kind of like segregated.

00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:26.531
I could feel people staring at me,
which I really didn't appreciate.

00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:30.001
But a lot of the time, the staff
were very courteous, allowed

00:06:30.001 --> 00:06:31.891
me to use lecture recordings.

00:06:32.281 --> 00:06:38.441
So that negated a lot of the negative
in person experiences I found.

00:06:39.241 --> 00:06:41.621
<v Dr Pam> I'm interested that
you said that people stare at you.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:44.591
I'm guessing that most of your
peers are fairly young people

00:06:44.591 --> 00:06:46.101
and you're a young person.

00:06:46.771 --> 00:06:50.141
You hear today that attitudes are
different, that people are different

00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:53.251
because they've been to school
with disabled children, they've

00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:54.931
grown up with disabled children.

00:06:55.471 --> 00:06:56.191
Do you find it?

00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:59.521
<v Nikita> That's not been
my personal experience.

00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:01.121
I know that it has been for some.

00:07:01.691 --> 00:07:06.881
I think that attitudes surrounding some
disabilities and such as neurodiversity

00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:11.851
and the use of walking sticks and
crutches has definitely changed.

00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:15.561
When I'm using my walking stick
the, there's no surprises there.

00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:20.231
There's no staring But when I use my
chair, yes, there's a lot of judgmental

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:26.831
looks there is a lot of judgmental, like,
comments and stares especially because

00:07:27.091 --> 00:07:29.991
often when I'm sitting in my chair
studying, I'll cross my legs just because

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:34.391
it's more comfortable, and the amount of
comments I've had, why are you using  a

00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:38.431
wheelchair, if you can walk, if you can
move your legs, if you can cross them, if

00:07:38.431 --> 00:07:43.251
I stand up briefly to go to the bathroom,
the judgment, don't even get me started

00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:48.061
on if I'm parking in a disability park,
and I get out of the car and pull out my

00:07:48.061 --> 00:07:50.211
wheelchair, there's a whole other story.

00:07:50.711 --> 00:07:55.071
To summarize it though, I think the
attitude regarding some mobility

00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:57.631
aids has changed but not quite.

00:07:58.801 --> 00:07:59.721
Not wheelchairs.

00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:03.781
<v Dr Pam> So there's some pretty rigid
assumptions being made, aren't there?

00:08:04.051 --> 00:08:08.001
I know when I had partial vision, I mean
I'm totally blind now, but when I had

00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:10.151
partial vision it was very difficult.

00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:11.501
It was far more difficult.

00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:16.971
from an attitudinal standpoint, external
attitudinal standpoint, than being

00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:20.701
totally blind because although people
don't really understand blindness either.

00:08:20.911 --> 00:08:24.561
In fact, now I keep getting, how
much can you see, which is bizarre

00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:26.031
because I've just told them I'm blind.

00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:31.001
But when you have some vision or
some mobility or whatever it is,

00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:34.451
people just seem to think, oh,
but you should be in this box.

00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:36.451
Why don't you fit in this neat box?

00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:39.441
It really challenges people, doesn't it?

00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:41.401
<v Nikita> It really does.

00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:46.771
And that's why I quite like talking
about how I have a dynamic disability.

00:08:47.071 --> 00:08:50.431
I came across that term, I can't
exactly remember where, but a couple

00:08:50.431 --> 00:08:55.131
of years ago now, and it's been a game
changer in educating people around me.

00:08:55.461 --> 00:08:58.971
I go, well, some days I can walk,
some days I can use my walking stick

00:08:58.991 --> 00:09:03.851
and other days I am in so much pain
I just cannot cope without my chair.

00:09:04.301 --> 00:09:08.431
And using a term such as dynamic
disability creates a different picture

00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:12.301
in people's minds  sets the scene
a little bit easier So people don't

00:09:12.311 --> 00:09:16.551
think so rigid about boxes and so rigid
about what disability should look like.

00:09:16.841 --> 00:09:18.111
It's got more fluidity

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:19.061
Speaker 2: Right.

00:09:19.451 --> 00:09:24.521
Yeah, i've heard the term before In terms
of people with multiple sclerosis, for

00:09:24.521 --> 00:09:29.031
example And those effects can be very
much the same, being able to maybe move

00:09:29.091 --> 00:09:33.651
around some degree some days and not
others, etc. And even having good vision

00:09:33.651 --> 00:09:36.081
one day and not others, just depending.

00:09:36.591 --> 00:09:41.171
What other barriers have
you dealt with, I guess?

00:09:41.616 --> 00:09:45.556
The major ones that you've dealt with
in your life so far, and I'm really

00:09:45.556 --> 00:09:49.646
interested in terms of supporting
other people as well, and how

00:09:49.646 --> 00:09:53.406
you've managed those and what you
might be able to pass on to others.

00:09:54.751 --> 00:09:58.121
<v Nikita> I think immediately what
comes to mind is a lot of people

00:09:58.121 --> 00:10:02.831
did not realize in my life that
I was disabled until quite late.

00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:04.511
Including my family.

00:10:04.511 --> 00:10:09.561
So, for example, I wasn't diagnosed
with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome until 20.

00:10:09.621 --> 00:10:11.641
Now that's still considered early.

00:10:11.826 --> 00:10:15.246
Within New Zealand statistics and don't
even get me started on that because

00:10:15.246 --> 00:10:16.836
we would never finish this podcast.

00:10:18.166 --> 00:10:22.556
I had been having issues since I was a
very young child with my joints, with

00:10:22.566 --> 00:10:28.556
getting sick constantly with digestive
issues, et cetera mobility issues.

00:10:29.256 --> 00:10:35.176
And it was always just painted as,
oh, they're being a hypochondriac.

00:10:35.226 --> 00:10:36.246
They're being dramatic.

00:10:36.796 --> 00:10:43.196
So, access to medical care, access to
understanding doctors, once my family and

00:10:43.196 --> 00:10:47.796
my friends did believe me became even more
of a challenge because exactly that, the

00:10:47.806 --> 00:10:52.366
stigma and the attitude of, oh, if you're
disabled, you do this, this, and this.

00:10:52.646 --> 00:10:56.646
So, for example, if you're really in that
much pain, you're just sitting in bed,

00:10:57.216 --> 00:10:59.086
doing nothing, feeling sorry for yourself.

00:10:59.336 --> 00:11:01.036
Now, that's not how I was raised.

00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:05.561
I was raised within, for example,
a martial arts setting, where you

00:11:05.561 --> 00:11:07.301
put on a brave face and you push on.

00:11:07.741 --> 00:11:11.531
Now I know that, now, that that is
actually quite dangerous for my body,

00:11:11.561 --> 00:11:17.891
but however, I, as a result, I was not
the stereotypical,  chronic pain person.

00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:19.501
I was doing a bachelor's.

00:11:19.811 --> 00:11:23.791
I was still competing in martial arts
and doing some martial arts workshops.

00:11:24.181 --> 00:11:27.941
I was living quite an active
life with my husband at the time.

00:11:28.331 --> 00:11:32.951
I was socializing with my friends
constantly, traveling to see my family

00:11:32.951 --> 00:11:38.251
in Tobor and Auckland, and I was
living a very full life still, which

00:11:38.251 --> 00:11:42.961
I think Because of the stereotype of
what disability and chronic illness

00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:45.251
looks like, threw a lot of people.

00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:50.641
But also, I've found that
people still have the idea that

00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:52.151
young people can't be disabled.

00:11:52.481 --> 00:11:53.221
Which has been

00:11:53.251 --> 00:11:53.601
<v Dr Pam> That's very true.

00:11:53.941 --> 00:11:54.381
Yeah.

00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:55.771
<v Nikita> Which is a challenge.

00:11:57.191 --> 00:12:00.211
And the best of times Oh,
you can't possibly have that.

00:12:00.211 --> 00:12:02.561
You're so young is a constant comment.

00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:07.151
Also the biggest barrier I have
found is the toxic positivity.

00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:12.551
Now, just so I'm clear, I do
believe in a positive mindset.

00:12:13.071 --> 00:12:19.491
I know that the more that you hyper
focus on your circumstances and the

00:12:19.491 --> 00:12:23.681
negative side of those circumstances,
it creates a negative feedback loop.

00:12:24.391 --> 00:12:25.861
Learnt that in my psych degree.

00:12:25.861 --> 00:12:32.741
However, I also don't believe that being
toxically positive helps anything, either,

00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:34.541
because then you push yourself too far,

00:12:35.031 --> 00:12:38.231
<v Dr Pam> Explain a bit more about
what you actually mean by toxically

00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:40.761
positive, in detail, if you would?

00:12:41.181 --> 00:12:47.931
<v Nikita> Yes, so toxic positivity,
If I give an example of, oh, but think

00:12:47.931 --> 00:12:51.871
of the bright side at least you can,
for example, my digestive issues, right?

00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:55.601
I really struggle to
eat meat, for example.

00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:59.541
I used to love steak growing
up and now I just can't do it.

00:13:00.001 --> 00:13:01.681
And people are, oh,
think of the positives.

00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:04.051
At least you get to eat
takeaways whenever you want.

00:13:04.111 --> 00:13:08.091
Not realizing that takeaways
makes me feel really gross because

00:13:08.091 --> 00:13:09.661
of all that heaviness, right?

00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:13.941
Look at the bright side, that you get to
just travel around in a chair whenever you

00:13:13.941 --> 00:13:18.351
want, but society's not set up for me to
travel around in a chair whenever I want.

00:13:19.041 --> 00:13:23.221
Oh, look on the bright side, at least
your walking stick matches your outfits.

00:13:23.391 --> 00:13:26.191
Yeah, but I would rather not
need this in the first place.

00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:28.191
<v Dr Pam> But it's just such fun.

00:13:28.411 --> 00:13:29.551
It is bizarre, isn't it?

00:13:29.571 --> 00:13:33.941
And yes, I must admit, I've also
come across that, and I totally

00:13:33.991 --> 00:13:35.371
taitoko what you're saying.

00:13:35.611 --> 00:13:38.571
I think that you, me, and Stella
Young could have had some very

00:13:38.571 --> 00:13:40.001
interesting conversations.

00:13:41.001 --> 00:13:43.581
Have you seen the video that Stella does?

00:13:43.681 --> 00:13:45.021
I'm Not Your Inspiration.

00:13:45.021 --> 00:13:46.051
Thank you very much.

00:13:46.481 --> 00:13:46.951
Seen that?

00:13:47.371 --> 00:13:47.401
<v Nikita> Yes.

00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:48.596
<v Dr Pam> That's awesome, isn't it?

00:13:49.096 --> 00:13:51.926
<v Nikita> I loved it and
I very much live by that.

00:13:51.966 --> 00:13:53.746
Oh, you're an inspiration for all you do.

00:13:54.206 --> 00:13:56.176
No, I'm just trying to live my life.

00:13:56.186 --> 00:13:57.746
Can you just back up a bit?

00:13:57.746 --> 00:14:01.056
Speaker 2: You talked about when
you were younger and that you

00:14:01.066 --> 00:14:04.252
knew that there were some issues
for you in terms of impairment.

00:14:04.252 --> 00:14:06.236
How did you feel?

00:14:06.716 --> 00:14:08.306
Like, I'm really interested.

00:14:08.326 --> 00:14:16.181
You said that nobody really realized until
you were 20 and that, It kind of, it felt

00:14:16.291 --> 00:14:21.061
odd, and I'm interested because just a bit
of personal disclosure, I was always told

00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:24.661
that my sight would never get any worse,
and so when it started getting worse when

00:14:24.661 --> 00:14:27.131
I was a teenager, it was really difficult.

00:14:27.131 --> 00:14:32.131
So I'm wondering for you, what was
teenagehood like with that overlay?

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:36.261
<v Nikita> I spent a lot of my
teenage life being in denial.

00:14:37.641 --> 00:14:40.481
I think so exactly that I was undiagnosed.

00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:43.941
I was that kid in school that
had the constant knee issues.

00:14:43.981 --> 00:14:47.281
So it was constantly in
braces or on crutches kind

00:14:47.281 --> 00:14:48.851
of expected to joke about it.

00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:53.661
So I had to be really lighthearted about
the fact that, oh, I was constantly

00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:56.771
in pain or, oh, my kneecap would
just slip out whenever it wanted.

00:14:58.511 --> 00:14:59.151
<v Dr Pam> That's horrible.

00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:01.091
That's toxic positivity, isn't it?

00:15:01.721 --> 00:15:02.111
<v Nikita> Yeah.

00:15:02.851 --> 00:15:06.161
Constantly expected to be upbeat,
look at the positives and oh, you

00:15:06.161 --> 00:15:09.081
know, everything will be fine being
the butt of people's joke about it.

00:15:09.731 --> 00:15:13.461
And I was very much in denial
because everyone around me

00:15:13.461 --> 00:15:14.761
was not taking it seriously.

00:15:14.801 --> 00:15:16.011
I wouldn't take it seriously.

00:15:16.331 --> 00:15:18.271
So I can't pretend that
anything's wrong here.

00:15:18.461 --> 00:15:23.231
I can't acknowledge what's going
on when deep down I knew, I knew

00:15:23.231 --> 00:15:25.981
something wasn't right at all.

00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:29.471
Not just with my joints, but I
would get fatigued a lot quicker.

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:33.541
As I said, my digestive issues,
I dealt with really bad insomnia

00:15:33.571 --> 00:15:35.101
as a result of chronic pain.

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:38.121
I was fainting a lot in
my teenage years as well.

00:15:38.941 --> 00:15:41.801
So I would, for example, go and
have a hot shower and then I would

00:15:41.801 --> 00:15:44.311
pass out, hit my head constantly.

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:50.521
<v Dr Pam> How did you manage discussing
that with your parents when you

00:15:50.521 --> 00:15:52.101
really knew, but didn't want to know?

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:53.561
And boy, do I know what that's like.

00:15:53.801 --> 00:15:55.781
How did you manage that with your parents?

00:15:57.121 --> 00:15:57.631
<v Nikita> I won't lie.

00:15:57.631 --> 00:15:59.371
It was difficult for a few years.

00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:02.301
My mother was very much
more understanding.

00:16:02.771 --> 00:16:07.111
She was still kind of in denial for
herself, but that turns out it's

00:16:07.111 --> 00:16:09.851
because she experienced the same
things and has the same condition.

00:16:10.311 --> 00:16:11.241
Just milder.

00:16:12.921 --> 00:16:18.571
My father I don't think my father
really knew much about it, to be honest

00:16:18.621 --> 00:16:20.791
because he was constantly at work.

00:16:20.791 --> 00:16:25.401
He was basically the sole breadwinner
through my teenage years, because my mum

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:28.321
was taking me to doctor's appointments,
trying to get my knee stabilised,

00:16:28.361 --> 00:16:31.751
because at the time we just thought,
Oh, if we fix the knee, it's a martial

00:16:31.751 --> 00:16:33.641
arts injury, everything will be fine.

00:16:35.791 --> 00:16:36.891
Newsflash, but not.

00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:37.261
But

00:16:39.241 --> 00:16:43.241
My parents did their best to support
me, but there was also contention

00:16:43.241 --> 00:16:48.811
because I would for example, I had
a fall and I thought Oh, I'm pretty

00:16:48.811 --> 00:16:50.081
sure I've dislocated my shoulder.

00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:53.721
And my parents were like, no,
no, no, you can't have done that.

00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:54.561
Don't be dramatic.

00:16:54.941 --> 00:16:59.981
I get to school and my shoulder had
ballooned to the point where we actually

00:16:59.981 --> 00:17:03.481
had to cut my bra strap to get my bra off.

00:17:03.541 --> 00:17:04.261
We couldn't move.

00:17:04.921 --> 00:17:06.721
And it had turned out that
I had popped my shoulder.

00:17:07.471 --> 00:17:13.461
So it was all to say it was a debate
quite a lot through my teenage years.

00:17:13.961 --> 00:17:17.481
I had very supportive family because
they knew something was wrong, but it was

00:17:17.481 --> 00:17:19.401
to the degree that something was wrong.

00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:22.731
They expected everything to kind
of stabilize and get better,

00:17:23.131 --> 00:17:24.821
which just wasn't what happened.

00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:28.451
<v Dr Pam> So what would you, what
would you tell your teenage self

00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:30.641
now if you had the opportunity?

00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:36.141
In other words, I guess what I'm
asking you to do is to share insights

00:17:36.361 --> 00:17:41.881
and tips to others who might, at this
very minute, have similar issues.

00:17:43.661 --> 00:17:47.741
<v Nikita> I would tell myself in my
teenage years that your new motto to

00:17:47.741 --> 00:17:50.611
life is to live life through adaption.

00:17:51.426 --> 00:17:54.986
So I choose to live my
life to the fullest extent.

00:17:55.056 --> 00:17:58.636
I just have to adapt it in
different ways than other people.

00:17:59.076 --> 00:18:03.446
And that by forcing yourself to try
and do everything in the same way that

00:18:03.446 --> 00:18:07.976
everyone else is doing things, you're
only going to cause yourself more pain.

00:18:08.276 --> 00:18:11.516
And you're also only going to feel
more grief when you realize you

00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:13.236
can't do what your peers are doing.

00:18:13.686 --> 00:18:14.856
So adapt what you're doing.

00:18:14.946 --> 00:18:15.956
There's no shame in it.

00:18:16.526 --> 00:18:21.376
And there's no shame in
arguing that something's wrong.

00:18:21.836 --> 00:18:26.056
It's okay to advocate for yourself
in that sense and get yourself

00:18:26.056 --> 00:18:27.096
the supports that you need.

00:18:29.146 --> 00:18:30.516
<v Dr Pam> Excellent, great advice.

00:18:30.906 --> 00:18:37.226
And do you find now that you helping
others with advocacy as well as yourself?

00:18:37.886 --> 00:18:43.826
<v Nikita> Yes I have been able to
support multiple people to get diagnosed

00:18:43.826 --> 00:18:46.766
with the same condition that I do
because they were bringing up their

00:18:46.766 --> 00:18:51.426
own experiences and I went, look, full
disclosure, I'm no doctor, but this

00:18:51.426 --> 00:18:53.466
is something I experienced as a kid.

00:18:53.566 --> 00:18:56.716
And if you really are worried, I
encourage you to speak to your doctor.

00:18:57.236 --> 00:19:01.746
And for, I think it's about six of
my friends now, it's turned out that

00:19:01.746 --> 00:19:05.606
they've had the same condition that I
do once they went and saw specialists.

00:19:05.616 --> 00:19:10.676
So, I've been able to advocate for
people to not only get diagnosis,

00:19:11.136 --> 00:19:15.786
but within, for example, NDSA, the
National Disabled Students Association,

00:19:16.106 --> 00:19:20.386
I've been able to help people get
reasonable accommodations and supports

00:19:20.386 --> 00:19:22.156
to help them continue with their study.

00:19:23.276 --> 00:19:23.956
<v Dr Pam> Fantastic.

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:24.716
That's great.

00:19:25.006 --> 00:19:27.796
And speaking of study and
going back to your masters.

00:19:28.366 --> 00:19:32.306
What are you looking to achieve
once you finish that degree?

00:19:33.376 --> 00:19:35.616
<v Nikita> Oh, when I've
finished my Masters, the study

00:19:35.616 --> 00:19:37.416
doesn't end, I want to do a PhD.

00:19:38.426 --> 00:19:40.566
<v Dr Pam> I don't have to worry
about that, I've just finished mine.

00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:48.356
<v Nikita> I want to create a
framework for youth with rare disorders,

00:19:48.356 --> 00:19:53.786
particularly Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, to
I want to be able to study through school

00:19:53.916 --> 00:19:56.336
from primary all the way up to tertiary.

00:19:56.616 --> 00:19:59.726
And I know that that's a big ask,
but I, that's what I want to do.

00:20:00.156 --> 00:20:04.706
Because I know that in high school,
if I, in particular, if I had known

00:20:04.706 --> 00:20:09.856
that I had a rare disorder, I would
have appreciated being able to have a

00:20:09.866 --> 00:20:14.286
framework to go to my teachers and to
who else was supporting me at the time

00:20:14.286 --> 00:20:16.656
and going, okay, this is what I need.

00:20:16.706 --> 00:20:18.186
I need to be able to study hybrid.

00:20:18.216 --> 00:20:22.166
I need to be able to have this
accommodation for my classes or

00:20:22.196 --> 00:20:24.896
I'm on this medication, which means
that the side effects are going to

00:20:24.896 --> 00:20:27.626
affect me at this period of the day.

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:31.716
So I need accommodations for this
being able to plan things adequately.

00:20:31.716 --> 00:20:34.186
And that's what I want
to use my PhD to do.

00:20:34.381 --> 00:20:37.551
<v Dr Pam> I'm wondering about
maybe working for the Ministry of

00:20:37.551 --> 00:20:39.121
Education or something like that.

00:20:40.941 --> 00:20:43.881
<v Nikita> Basically anywhere that
I can do disability research I want

00:20:43.881 --> 00:20:50.321
my PhD to be in exactly that, the
creation of a, Framework for rare

00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:56.381
disorders within education, but I want
to do all sorts of research and in

00:20:56.381 --> 00:21:01.271
regards to disability I want to look at
neurodivergence and its correlation with

00:21:01.641 --> 00:21:03.691
multiple different types of disability.

00:21:04.011 --> 00:21:08.451
I want to create disability policy
within workplaces to make workplaces

00:21:08.451 --> 00:21:11.111
more accessible, disability action plans.

00:21:11.141 --> 00:21:14.831
I'm hugely passionate about disability
action plans If you were asking

00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:16.821
me, Everywhere should have them.

00:21:17.091 --> 00:21:21.651
Tertiary institutes, high schools,
primary schools, workplaces,

00:21:21.861 --> 00:21:25.141
government organizations, everywhere
should have disability action plans.

00:21:25.141 --> 00:21:25.871
I love them.

00:21:25.871 --> 00:21:28.441
<v Dr Pam> You're a true force of nature.

00:21:29.271 --> 00:21:33.271
I feel tired just listening to you,
but yeah, I think that it sounds

00:21:33.271 --> 00:21:36.711
as if you're going to have a great
future in research and advocacy.

00:21:37.616 --> 00:21:38.306
<v Nikita> Thank you.

00:21:38.556 --> 00:21:38.956
Yeah.

00:21:38.966 --> 00:21:39.026
Thank you.

00:21:39.836 --> 00:21:40.756
<v Dr Pam> Sounds wonderful.

00:21:41.896 --> 00:21:45.346
What other things do you want
for your life and to be able

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:46.996
to maybe work with others?

00:21:48.216 --> 00:21:49.756
<v Nikita> There's a lot to be honest.

00:21:50.066 --> 00:21:54.876
So I'm currently public speaking for
a couple of different organisations,

00:21:54.906 --> 00:22:00.286
I guest lecture for a couple of
different universities as well, on

00:22:00.306 --> 00:22:04.586
leadership, disability within education
particularly at the university of

00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:09.146
Waikato, I guess, lecture for one of
their courses on supporting teachers

00:22:09.146 --> 00:22:13.866
to teach disabled students and the
experiences of disabled students.

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:15.646
So I want to continue that.

00:22:16.066 --> 00:22:18.106
I want to continue public speaking.

00:22:18.146 --> 00:22:21.216
I want to continue working
with disability organizations.

00:22:21.666 --> 00:22:28.286
I do want to set up a dojo at some point
where I can teach adaptive martial arts.

00:22:28.711 --> 00:22:30.051
From a base.

00:22:30.251 --> 00:22:31.321
<v Dr Pam> What a great idea.

00:22:32.221 --> 00:22:36.031
Yeah, and would that include
people with other impairments?

00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:39.561
Would you be interested in teaching
blind people say for example?

00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:42.701
<v Nikita> One of the best
martial artists that I ever met

00:22:42.751 --> 00:22:45.011
at my dojo was a blind woman.

00:22:45.381 --> 00:22:45.741
<v Dr Pam> Mm hmm.

00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:51.691
<v Nikita> And I asked how she was
able to do her form work so clearly.

00:22:51.921 --> 00:22:54.101
And when I say that it was beautiful.

00:22:54.121 --> 00:22:54.791
It was immaculate.

00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:57.631
Her hands and her arms would
always be in the correct place.

00:22:58.281 --> 00:23:00.321
And She was like, I can feel it.

00:23:00.351 --> 00:23:02.431
I can feel the floor.

00:23:02.431 --> 00:23:04.371
I can feel where everything needs to be.

00:23:04.731 --> 00:23:07.981
So I want to support all impairments
to be able to do martial arts.

00:23:08.001 --> 00:23:13.191
I recognize that I can't remember the
specific statistics, but I did read

00:23:13.271 --> 00:23:17.271
that disabled people are more likely to
experience violence, whether it's bullying

00:23:17.341 --> 00:23:18.601
or whether it's domestic violence.

00:23:19.871 --> 00:23:23.011
And I want to be able to support
disabled people to defend themselves.

00:23:23.071 --> 00:23:27.691
And I very much believe in Shaolin
Kenpo being one of the best,

00:23:27.721 --> 00:23:29.181
and I will die on that hill.

00:23:29.361 --> 00:23:30.821
But I want to support everyone.

00:23:30.821 --> 00:23:34.521
So for example, my brother who is
autistic, he used to train with me.

00:23:35.011 --> 00:23:35.826
I do want to support disabled people.

00:23:35.896 --> 00:23:36.856
Blind people to train.

00:23:36.856 --> 00:23:38.656
I want to support people
in wheelchairs to train.

00:23:38.656 --> 00:23:41.576
I want to support those with
intellectual disabilities to train.

00:23:41.856 --> 00:23:43.596
I want to support deaf people to train.

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:45.386
<v Dr Pam> Everyone.

00:23:45.436 --> 00:23:47.476
I want it to be a career in itself.

00:23:47.656 --> 00:23:50.496
So it sounds to me like
you're into multiple careers.

00:23:50.546 --> 00:23:53.336
<v Nikita> To be honest, none of
my family members, even in their own

00:23:53.336 --> 00:23:57.876
careers, have ever  understood the
word relax or retirement or holiday.

00:23:59.286 --> 00:24:01.881
<v Dr Pam> Yeah, I don't use
the R word for retirement either,

00:24:01.881 --> 00:24:06.125
even though I am between you and I
over 65, but retire, what's that?

00:24:06.325 --> 00:24:12.605
Think for some disabled people it takes
us quite some time to establish ourselves

00:24:12.635 --> 00:24:18.725
as professionals or in whatever avenue
that we want to work in, whether it's

00:24:18.735 --> 00:24:24.965
voluntarily or in a paid capacity, that
we don't necessarily have an end date.

00:24:26.155 --> 00:24:27.345
<v Nikita> I completely agree with you.

00:24:27.405 --> 00:24:30.315
It takes so much longer
for us to get established.

00:24:30.325 --> 00:24:31.575
Sorry for my constant moving.

00:24:31.575 --> 00:24:33.565
My legs get pretty sore pretty quickly.

00:24:34.075 --> 00:24:38.675
I think it takes so much longer for us
to get established within employment

00:24:38.705 --> 00:24:43.160
and within a career compared to non
disabled people, especially when

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.310
we're trying to do what we love.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.830
And the disability sector, of
which I want to go into, is

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.300
notoriously hard to get into, even
though you're a disabled person.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:53.440
It's, I have feelings there.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.110
<v Dr Pam> I'd really like to hear those
feelings, if you're prepared to share.

00:24:57.975 --> 00:24:58.565
<v Nikita> I am.

00:24:58.705 --> 00:25:01.565
A little bit of context,  I'm quite
blunt, which sometimes gets me in

00:25:01.565 --> 00:25:04.105
a bit of trouble, but it works.

00:25:04.415 --> 00:25:06.845
I don't think there's enough
disabled people in leadership.

00:25:07.875 --> 00:25:11.555
I think we're consulted on
quite often in a lot of spaces.

00:25:11.555 --> 00:25:14.095
And don't get me wrong, we could
be consulted a lot more than we

00:25:14.095 --> 00:25:17.835
are, but often we're consulted
with, and we're not leading.

00:25:18.585 --> 00:25:19.545
And we should be leading.

00:25:19.575 --> 00:25:24.055
And I also think within the disability
sector, certain disabilities

00:25:24.845 --> 00:25:28.215
are ranked is the wrong word.

00:25:28.775 --> 00:25:30.855
I don't know what word
I would use, though.

00:25:31.465 --> 00:25:37.165
For example, if I use my experience
I struggle to find paid employment

00:25:37.935 --> 00:25:39.505
because I use a wheelchair.

00:25:40.505 --> 00:25:46.235
Whereas my brother has perhaps not
struggled so much because a lot of people

00:25:46.235 --> 00:25:50.565
find, at least in his experience, I know
this is not everyone's experience, but

00:25:50.565 --> 00:25:55.485
in his experience, Autistic people are
easier to support within the workplace

00:25:55.525 --> 00:25:58.205
than say, somebody who uses a wheelchair.

00:25:58.805 --> 00:26:01.775
<v Dr Pam> If I can be crass,
they look normal compared to us.

00:26:02.585 --> 00:26:03.025
<v Nikita> Yes.

00:26:03.725 --> 00:26:06.805
<v Dr Pam> Because we use guide dogs,
wheelchairs, white canes, whatever.

00:26:08.445 --> 00:26:11.428
<v Nikita> And so I feel  like
ranking's the wrong word, perhaps,

00:26:11.838 --> 00:26:13.378
but I'm not sure quite what else

00:26:13.378 --> 00:26:14.688
<v Dr Pam> it's a kind
of hierarchy, isn't it?

00:26:15.078 --> 00:26:15.378
Yeah.

00:26:16.228 --> 00:26:20.638
<v Nikita> So I believe that there
needs to be more representation

00:26:20.868 --> 00:26:23.548
of different types of disabilities
within the disability sector.

00:26:24.068 --> 00:26:27.968
I believe that there needs to be
more disabled people in leadership.

00:26:28.288 --> 00:26:32.978
If it boils down to it, we need more
disabled people in leadership, rather

00:26:32.978 --> 00:26:36.748
than just being consulted with, we need
to be the ones leading the charge, and

00:26:36.748 --> 00:26:38.618
we are more than capable of doing so.

00:26:40.898 --> 00:26:43.878
<v Dr Pam> That was actually the
whole thrust of my PhD thesis,

00:26:43.878 --> 00:26:45.268
so I'll have to send you a copy.

00:26:46.548 --> 00:26:48.978
And yeah, I couldn't agree more.

00:26:49.018 --> 00:26:53.528
I think that leadership and management
is extremely important and I mean, I

00:26:53.528 --> 00:26:57.088
suppose if you think about it, every
other group in society that you can

00:26:57.088 --> 00:27:01.498
think of is led and managed by its
own members, which is as it should be.

00:27:02.098 --> 00:27:05.938
And probably the disability
sector is the only one that's not.

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:08.098
<v Nikita> I completely
agree with you though.

00:27:08.748 --> 00:27:12.148
I will just keep echoing it, there's
not enough disabled people in

00:27:12.148 --> 00:27:13.898
leadership and I couldn't tell you why.

00:27:14.168 --> 00:27:20.338
I really couldn't tell you why, other
than maybe for some places it's easier

00:27:20.418 --> 00:27:24.378
for example, to not hire wheelchair
users because accessibility, trying

00:27:24.378 --> 00:27:26.158
to fix that is a whole nightmare.

00:27:26.718 --> 00:27:28.258
Which doesn't make it fair.

00:27:28.258 --> 00:27:28.318
Yeah.

00:27:28.498 --> 00:27:33.368
And I know life's not fair, but that's, I
get very upset and angry about it, to be

00:27:33.368 --> 00:27:39.048
honest because I watch other incredible
leaders, forget myself for a sec, I watch

00:27:39.098 --> 00:27:44.558
other incredible leaders struggle to
find work because their disabilities are

00:27:44.558 --> 00:27:50.973
dynamic and change, for example, they're
not, Staple, the same, constant, that

00:27:51.063 --> 00:27:55.333
some days they will be fine, other days
they will be in hospital, other days they

00:27:55.333 --> 00:27:59.243
need a chair, some days they can need
no mobility aid, and they struggle to

00:27:59.243 --> 00:28:04.303
find work, but they are some of the most
dedicated, passionate, smart, empathetic

00:28:04.303 --> 00:28:08.583
people I have ever met in my life, and
they struggle to get work just because

00:28:08.603 --> 00:28:12.073
their disability is, is what it is.

00:28:12.408 --> 00:28:12.798
<v Dr Pam> Yeah.

00:28:13.338 --> 00:28:17.358
And so it tells us, I think, that
there needs to be more universality

00:28:17.368 --> 00:28:21.818
in the design of not only the built
environment, but also in workplaces

00:28:21.858 --> 00:28:27.178
and in the way we think about people
and the way that we accommodate people

00:28:27.498 --> 00:28:32.488
and the recognition that we share such
a lot, but we have our differences

00:28:32.508 --> 00:28:35.178
and those things enrich all of us.

00:28:36.243 --> 00:28:42.393
<v Nikita> I am a huge believer
that there needs to be some sense

00:28:42.413 --> 00:28:48.033
of compulsory education within the
workplace on, at minimum, the social

00:28:48.043 --> 00:28:52.813
model of disability, but preferably
the human rights model of disability.

00:28:53.463 --> 00:28:55.263
Because I think that would change
a lot of things, to be honest.

00:28:55.263 --> 00:28:55.943
<v Dr Pam> I agree.

00:28:55.943 --> 00:28:57.393
I think it would be very helpful.

00:28:57.453 --> 00:29:02.623
And that's an area that I work in, but
it's very hard to convince people that

00:29:02.623 --> 00:29:06.783
they need something they didn't know they
wanted or they didn't know they needed.

00:29:06.993 --> 00:29:10.573
Once they've had the training,
then they recognize they needed it.

00:29:10.683 --> 00:29:15.013
But it's getting your foot in the
door, as with so many other things.

00:29:15.473 --> 00:29:20.103
<v Nikita> I want to say, a lot of
disabled leaders that I've met get

00:29:20.113 --> 00:29:24.993
discouraged because they feel like
they're not disabled enough, or they're

00:29:24.993 --> 00:29:31.253
not disabled in a certain way, or they're
not eloquent enough that's not true.

00:29:31.573 --> 00:29:32.528
That is not true.

00:29:32.978 --> 00:29:37.658
I personally got to where I am, and
I believe this with every fibre of

00:29:37.678 --> 00:29:43.038
my being, because I just wouldn't
shut up, and I called it as it is.

00:29:43.088 --> 00:29:49.528
I didn't use any fancy language, I
didn't use any particular tone, I just

00:29:49.538 --> 00:29:54.668
wouldn't shut up, and I kept going with
my passion, and when one door shut, I

00:29:54.668 --> 00:29:56.208
looked for another door that was open.

00:29:56.778 --> 00:30:00.258
You don't have to be a
certain image of disabled.

00:30:01.018 --> 00:30:04.348
You don't have to be pleasing on
the ear to listen to in that sense,

00:30:04.398 --> 00:30:06.518
tone wise or using fancy language.

00:30:07.218 --> 00:30:11.438
Passion is enough and if you
keep pushing, doors will open.

00:30:11.908 --> 00:30:15.598
Three years ago, I wouldn't think that
I'm speaking to you about my experience.

00:30:15.598 --> 00:30:19.358
I wouldn't think that I would be
guest lecturing for unis or having

00:30:19.358 --> 00:30:25.188
had done a workshop with the United
Nations sector, which is called

00:30:25.188 --> 00:30:27.628
UNESCO on rare disorders in education.

00:30:27.938 --> 00:30:30.808
Oh, I would have laughed in your
face if you had told me that.

00:30:31.818 --> 00:30:34.468
But I kept yelling and
that's how I got here.

00:30:34.878 --> 00:30:36.728
<v Dr Pam> Yeah, so don't
just knock on those doors.

00:30:36.738 --> 00:30:37.658
Hammer on them.

00:30:37.788 --> 00:30:41.008
Absolutely insist that they be
open, is what I'm hearing from you.

00:30:41.308 --> 00:30:43.848
<v Nikita> Take a sledgehammer
and sledge through that door.

00:30:46.018 --> 00:30:47.848
<v Dr Pam> Nikita, you're
such a breath of fresh air.

00:30:47.848 --> 00:30:51.588
It's been wonderful speaking to
you today and I want to wish you

00:30:51.658 --> 00:30:55.228
all the very, very best for the
future in everything that you do.

00:30:55.768 --> 00:30:59.888
I'm absolutely sure that we'll keep
hearing your name again and again.

00:31:00.068 --> 00:31:02.578
And I hope our paths continue to cross.

00:31:02.578 --> 00:31:03.708
Thank you so much.

00:31:04.748 --> 00:31:05.678
<v Nikita> I hope so, too.

00:31:06.068 --> 00:31:07.948
Thank you so much for this opportunity

00:31:11.241 --> 00:31:16.231
<v Bill>  Introducing Ask Dr. Pam,
the advice segment, where Dr. Pam

00:31:16.231 --> 00:31:21.141
MacNeill answers your questions
with expertise, empathy, and a

00:31:21.141 --> 00:31:23.211
passion for disability rights.

00:31:26.787 --> 00:31:28.847
<v Person 1 with question> So  the
question  that  we  are  reflecting  on

00:31:28.847 --> 00:31:36.707
is,  what  is  the  role  of  employment
in  fostering  inclusion  and  belonging?

00:31:36.977 --> 00:31:39.997
<v Dr Pam> I  want  to  start
a  courageous  conversation

00:31:40.047 --> 00:31:44.537
by  focusing  on  inclusion  and
belonging  ,   through  employment

00:31:44.537 --> 00:31:46.597
in  the  disability  sector  itself.

00:31:48.037 --> 00:31:51.057
This  includes  all  work
undertaken  in  our  name,  the

00:31:51.057 --> 00:31:52.277
name  of  disabled  people.

00:31:52.457 --> 00:31:56.887
So  it  means, within  support
services,  DPOs,  government

00:31:56.887 --> 00:32:00.707
jobs,  where  disability  is  a
focus  right  across  the  board.

00:32:02.647 --> 00:32:08.272
Research  shows  that, barriers  to
employment,  tenure,  and  promotion

00:32:08.272 --> 00:32:13.372
are  prevalent  in  the  disability
sector,  just  as  prevalent  as  they

00:32:13.372 --> 00:32:17.012
are  anywhere  else,  and  I  should
know,  I  did  the  research,  and  I'm

00:32:17.012 --> 00:32:20.032
happy  to  share  that  with  anyone  and
everyone  who  might  be  interested.

00:32:20.432 --> 00:32:22.332
Ableism  is  also  common.

00:32:22.527 --> 00:32:27.887
You  might  be  surprised  to  hear,
and  this  includes  casual  ableism,

00:32:28.187 --> 00:32:32.607
which  is  a  term  I've  developed  to
mean  when  people decide  that  they're

00:32:32.607 --> 00:32:36.401
going  to  use  terms  such  as  turning
a  blind  eye  or  a  deaf  ear   it's

00:32:36.401 --> 00:32:41.866
important  that  disabled  people  model,
what  is  possible  and  I  did  do  that

00:32:41.866 --> 00:32:45.986
for  18  years  when  I  was  the  manager
of  the  Mainstream  Employment  Programme

00:32:46.166 --> 00:32:51.536
and  I  korero  what  Gretchen  was  just
saying  that ,  it's  really  important

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:56.846
that  we  do  model  these  things,  that
supported  employment  is  definitely  a

00:32:56.846 --> 00:33:01.026
way  to  get  your  foot,  your  wheel,
your  guide  dog  in  the  door  of

00:33:01.026 --> 00:33:04.276
employment,  and  I  know  that  during
the  time  I  managed  the  Mainstream

00:33:04.276 --> 00:33:09.631
Programme over  3 ,000  people  got  work
and  a  couple  of  years  after  their

00:33:09.631 --> 00:33:13.571
placements  finished,  61  percent  of
those  people  were  still  in  work.

00:33:13.891 --> 00:33:17.511
So  I  think  that  proves  that
that's  a  very  good  way  to  manage

00:33:17.511 --> 00:33:19.771
a  program  for  disabled  people.

00:33:20.831 --> 00:33:23.671
Lots of  purists  say  it  shouldn't
have  to  happen  that  way.

00:33:23.971 --> 00:33:26.311
I  agree,  but  let's  face
it,  we  don't  live  in  a

00:33:26.311 --> 00:33:27.751
perfect  world,  far  from  it.

00:33:27.771 --> 00:33:32.521
At  the  moment,   we're  in  a
position  where  too  many  people

00:33:32.521 --> 00:33:35.881
speak  on  behalf  of  disabled
people  when  we're  perfectly

00:33:35.881 --> 00:33:38.301
capable  of  speaking  for  ourselves.

00:33:40.221 --> 00:33:44.381
Many  people  who  work  in  the
disability  sector  or  the  disability

00:33:44.381 --> 00:33:48.061
industry  as  I've  heard  it  called,
which  then  makes  us  commodities,

00:33:48.961 --> 00:33:52.761
,  feel  that  disabled  people  are
not  able  to  work  in  some  of

00:33:52.761 --> 00:33:56.641
these  positions,  that  we're  not
qualified  and  we  don't  have  the

00:33:56.641 --> 00:33:58.461
potential  that  they  might  have.

00:33:58.576 --> 00:34:04.256
But  how  can  we  promote  the
abilities  of  disabled  people

00:34:04.256 --> 00:34:08.056
to  others  if  we  don't  employ
disabled  people  ourselves?

00:34:10.236 --> 00:34:13.156
So  the  sector  is  currently  not
practising  what  it  preaches.

00:34:14.074 --> 00:34:17.274
An  example  of  this  is,   a
couple  of  large  disability

00:34:17.274 --> 00:34:20.554
agencies  in  Australasia  recently,
went  to  employ  their  chief

00:34:20.554 --> 00:34:24.274
executives  and  they  had  lots  of
applications  from  disabled  people.

00:34:24.714 --> 00:34:28.374
Extremely  well  qualified,
internationally  recognised  disabled

00:34:28.374 --> 00:34:32.414
people  and  neither  of  those
organisations  took  up  the  opportunity.

00:34:33.094 --> 00:34:36.814
In  fact,  they  did  everything  they
could  to  avoid  doing  the  right

00:34:36.814 --> 00:34:40.234
thing,  which  is  employing  someone
from  the  group  they  support.

00:34:42.274 --> 00:34:47.714
Lived  experience  of  disability  needs
to  be  a  key  component  of  what  we

00:34:47.714 --> 00:34:49.834
call  merit  in  the  disability  sector.

00:34:50.034 --> 00:34:53.854
And  by  the  way,  merit  actually
is  a  general  principle,  advantage

00:34:53.854 --> 00:34:55.314
is  the  already  privileged.

00:34:55.834 --> 00:34:58.574
But  if  we're  going  to  talk
about  merit,  let's  include

00:34:58.574 --> 00:35:02.514
lived  experience  of  disability
for disability sector work.

00:35:03.344 --> 00:35:07.134
Disability alone,  doesn't  qualify
disabled  people  for  leadership.

00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:11.529
I  know  that,  but  then  neither
does being non-disabled either.

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:16.109
So  you  don't  automatically  get  a
hospital  pass  if  you're  non -disabled.

00:35:16.889 --> 00:35:20.589
Everyone  has  to  have  skills,
abilities,  experience,  etc.

00:35:20.849 --> 00:35:21.949
That's  well  recognised.

00:35:22.394 --> 00:35:28.054
The  thing  that  needs  to  be
recognised  is  that  disabled  people

00:35:28.054 --> 00:35:33.574
have  the  authentic  mandate  to
lead  and  manage  our  own  sector.

00:35:33.834 --> 00:35:37.954
Just  as  others  lead  and  manage
their  own  sectors,  it  really

00:35:37.954 --> 00:35:41.634
isn't  that  difficult  to  work
out  why  this  would  be  the  case.

00:35:41.659 --> 00:35:48.739
I  challenge  all  of  you  here
today  to  intentionally  attract,

00:35:49.259 --> 00:35:53.859
recruit  and  retain  disabled
people  into  work  in  your  sectors,

00:35:54.319 --> 00:35:56.519
particularly  in  leadership  roles.

00:35:57.319 --> 00:36:00.259
And  I'm  very  happy  for  my  email
to  be  shared  if  people  would  like

00:36:00.259 --> 00:36:01.619
to  hear  more  about  my  research.

00:36:01.719 --> 00:36:04.419
I  came  up  with  some  very
practical  ways  that  we  could

00:36:04.419 --> 00:36:08.119
increase  employment,  particularly
in  the  disability  sector.

00:36:08.479 --> 00:36:09.339
Thank  you  very  much.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.003
<v Person 2 with question> One  of
the  questions  is,  "How  do  we  get

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:17.243
around  Still  not  feeling  safe  to
tell  our  stories. Our  stories  aren't

00:36:17.243 --> 00:36:20.923
always  inspirational  and  always
flatter  potential  employers  honestly.

00:36:20.943 --> 00:36:25.863
So  how  do  we  boldly  go  there,  when
we  also  need  to  make  a  living?"

00:36:26.663 --> 00:36:28.183
<v Dr Pam> Can  I  make
a  comment,  please?

00:36:28.283 --> 00:36:31.323
It's  Pam  McNeill  here  from
