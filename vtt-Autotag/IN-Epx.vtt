WEBVTT

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.679
<v Expert1>Let's engage with
disabled people about what

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:05.000
we are going to do for them.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.850
<v Expert2>We must remember to ensure
everyone is consulted, including a

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.810
small percentage of disabled people.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.000
It's fine for others to
speak on their behalf.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.630
<v Jonathan>No, way, let's
disrupt the disability discourse.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.119
It's the Disability
Disrupters Podcast with Dr.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.020
Pam MacNeill.

00:00:21.698 --> 00:00:24.578
<v Dr Pam>Greetings everyone, and
welcome to February's edition of

00:00:24.578 --> 00:00:26.918
the Disability Disrupters podcast.

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:32.768
Today's guest is Kylee Maloney,
former broadcaster, current fan

00:00:32.768 --> 00:00:34.568
fiction writer, and Gym Bunny.

00:00:35.048 --> 00:00:37.208
Kylee's interview is not to be missed.

00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:41.068
Remember, if you know someone you think
we should interview or you just wanna

00:00:41.068 --> 00:00:42.931
get in touch, we'd love to hear from you.

00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:50.306
Send an email to disrupters@drnz.co.nz
with your thoughts on

00:00:50.306 --> 00:00:52.196
disability related topics.

00:00:52.526 --> 00:00:54.356
We look forward to hearing from you.

00:00:55.226 --> 00:00:57.836
now, sit back, relax, and
enjoy this month's show.

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:12.178
You are involved with the Royal New
Zealand Foundation for the Blind Redress

00:01:12.178 --> 00:01:18.538
Group, as am I. But I want to talk to you
about the group from your perspective,

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:22.138
how things have tracked, how it all began.

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:25.993
If you can basically let people
know, because I think that around

00:01:25.993 --> 00:01:31.153
the world there are a lot of people
who are in a similar Situation.

00:01:31.303 --> 00:01:36.163
There have perhaps been royal commissions
of inquiry or other types of inquiries

00:01:36.223 --> 00:01:41.983
into abuse in the care of the state or
church, and I think that from a disability

00:01:41.983 --> 00:01:43.658
perspective, this one's a bit unusual.

00:01:45.043 --> 00:01:49.093
<v Kylee>Yes it is, because,
I think for the first time a

00:01:49.093 --> 00:01:55.908
charity has allowed a group of
survivors to call the tune really.

00:01:56.628 --> 00:02:00.528
And that is unusual, especially
for a disability organization.

00:02:01.248 --> 00:02:05.688
For me, it started, I was one of the
people profiled in the commission.

00:02:05.738 --> 00:02:09.318
The report has a number
of case histories in it.

00:02:09.318 --> 00:02:10.098
Mine was one of them.

00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:16.698
And then after it was released, the
then chair of the board issued an email,

00:02:16.698 --> 00:02:19.368
which looked to me like all but denial.

00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:23.998
So I contacted the  chief
executive as I know you did.

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:29.328
And she formed this group out of people
who had contacted her or people who

00:02:29.328 --> 00:02:32.058
she had found through other means.

00:02:32.358 --> 00:02:34.403
And that's basically how it started.

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:40.033
She wanted people, to get together,
survivors who could move the thing

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:43.628
forward, who could co-design an
apology, which we did over a year.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.823
That was a lot of back and forth email.

00:02:47.188 --> 00:02:50.578
Wrangling over words
because words are important.

00:02:51.478 --> 00:02:56.248
And the apology happened on the 18th of
September by this time where our group

00:02:56.248 --> 00:03:01.438
had been formed and we'd already started,
and now we are working on a framework for

00:03:01.438 --> 00:03:05.338
compensation and redress, which is huge.

00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:07.018
I've never done anything like this before.

00:03:07.018 --> 00:03:09.058
I do the admin basically.

00:03:09.058 --> 00:03:14.188
I set up the Zoom meetings and do the
minutes and things like that, but, and

00:03:14.188 --> 00:03:17.988
also provide some wordsmithing, we all
play to our strengths and I think that's

00:03:17.988 --> 00:03:19.308
what's really good about this group.

00:03:19.308 --> 00:03:22.278
There's only four of us, but
we all have different strengths

00:03:22.398 --> 00:03:23.748
and we're all complimentary.

00:03:23.748 --> 00:03:28.598
I don't think I've ever worked
with such a cohesive group.

00:03:29.598 --> 00:03:33.578
<v Dr Pam>That's right and as you say,
the apology was last year in September

00:03:33.858 --> 00:03:39.193
and since then we've been busy putting
together a framework and timeline.

00:03:39.193 --> 00:03:43.333
We've got two years to basically
do this task and it's not quite

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:44.743
as easy as you would think, is

00:03:44.743 --> 00:03:47.948
it because, as you say, all the
wordsmithing we've had to do?

00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:54.813
<v Kylee>It's a huge job and really
does involve all of our skills.

00:03:54.813 --> 00:03:55.683
All four of us.

00:03:55.683 --> 00:03:59.103
We've all got different skills
that we contribute, and it really

00:03:59.103 --> 00:04:00.813
does involve all of them, I think

00:04:01.563 --> 00:04:03.813
more than even we suspected.

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:05.913
But at the moment, things are going well.

00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:13.633
We are tracking well, and I think we're
on target to produce our document at

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:18.043
the board meeting in March, so that'll
be exciting to see how they receive it.

00:04:18.673 --> 00:04:19.003
<v Dr Pam>yes.

00:04:19.003 --> 00:04:19.243
And then

00:04:19.243 --> 00:04:24.133
we can start working on applications
and we really keen to hear from anyone

00:04:24.223 --> 00:04:26.053
who feels that they were impacted,

00:04:26.413 --> 00:04:30.558
anyone who's blind or low vision or deaf
blind, who feels they were impacted.

00:04:31.108 --> 00:04:32.278
Needs to get in touch.

00:04:32.278 --> 00:04:35.638
I, I'll leave Steffie's email address.

00:04:35.638 --> 00:04:39.688
Steffie Birkhead is our first
contact person and I'll leave

00:04:39.688 --> 00:04:43.898
her address and other information
about the group in the show notes.

00:04:44.248 --> 00:04:45.928
But just to profile who we are.

00:04:45.928 --> 00:04:51.598
There's you, Kylee, there's
Dr. Don McLaren from Geraldine.

00:04:51.648 --> 00:04:53.428
So Geraldine in the South Island.

00:04:53.858 --> 00:04:58.598
There's Steffie Birkhead
who lives in, remind me,

00:04:58.818 --> 00:05:00.518
<v Kylee>In Missouri in the USA.

00:05:00.658 --> 00:05:02.738
<v Dr Pam>Not Misery, Missouri

00:05:03.103 --> 00:05:05.803
Although actually I think their
weather's been pretty bad, so maybe

00:05:05.803 --> 00:05:07.303
she does live in Misery at the moment.

00:05:07.853 --> 00:05:09.773
But yeah, so there's four of us.

00:05:09.773 --> 00:05:14.543
I'm chairing, but we've all got equal
participation and equal responsibility.

00:05:14.543 --> 00:05:18.168
It's just as you said, so
well, a question of people.

00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:22.793
Playing to their strengths, and we
communicate directly to the chief

00:05:22.793 --> 00:05:25.223
executive at Blind and Low Vision.

00:05:25.613 --> 00:05:27.833
So it's a bit complicated, isn't it?

00:05:27.893 --> 00:05:31.083
Kylee, do you wanna unpick that
whole thing of, we're talking about

00:05:31.083 --> 00:05:35.073
the Royal New Zealand Foundation for
the Blind on the one hand and then

00:05:35.073 --> 00:05:36.603
blind and low vision on the other

00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:39.393
<v Kylee>it was Royal New Zealand
Foundation for the Blind until,

00:05:39.393 --> 00:05:41.253
what, 2001 or something like that?

00:05:41.643 --> 00:05:42.453
<v Dr Pam>something like that.

00:05:42.453 --> 00:05:42.753
Yep.

00:05:43.228 --> 00:05:48.073
<v Kylee>When it changed to of the blind
because we it, the, it used to be governed

00:05:48.073 --> 00:05:51.613
by an act of Parliament and of course
the royal means it has a Royal warrant.

00:05:52.603 --> 00:05:56.053
The organization is still Royal New
Zealand Foundation of the Blind.

00:05:56.053 --> 00:05:57.583
That's its legal name

00:05:57.863 --> 00:06:01.283
It's still has its Royal Warrant,
but the brand name, the business name

00:06:01.733 --> 00:06:03.773
that it uses is Blind Low Vision nz.

00:06:04.323 --> 00:06:05.673
<v Dr Pam>That was very well put.

00:06:05.913 --> 00:06:10.083
So if anyone was confused, hopefully
that's cleared up your confusion.

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:13.253
We've got a meeting coming
up shortly, actually.

00:06:13.253 --> 00:06:14.513
So we are meeting once a month.

00:06:14.513 --> 00:06:16.493
We're sometimes meeting
twice a month, aren't we?

00:06:17.153 --> 00:06:20.248
<v Kylee>Yeah, occasionally we meet
twice a month, but  our next meeting

00:06:20.248 --> 00:06:23.738
is coming up where we'll bring together
a lot of the strands that we've all

00:06:23.738 --> 00:06:30.518
been working on for this document and
application process, which has been quite

00:06:31.508 --> 00:06:33.368
exciting to see it coming together really.

00:06:33.368 --> 00:06:35.908
But yes, a huge amount of work for all of

00:06:35.998 --> 00:06:37.738
<v Dr Pam>Lots and lots of emails.

00:06:37.738 --> 00:06:39.898
So obviously we've got
a group that we set up.

00:06:39.898 --> 00:06:44.653
We've got a Dropbox folder, etc. So
if anybody's thinking of starting

00:06:44.653 --> 00:06:48.133
anything similar to this drop us a
line 'cause I'm sure we can probably

00:06:48.133 --> 00:06:51.063
advise people on the pitfalls and
the good things about doing it.

00:06:51.893 --> 00:06:57.703
Kylee, do you want to move on and tell
people a bit more about you, who you are?

00:06:59.928 --> 00:07:02.178
Because you've got a
really brilliant history

00:07:02.238 --> 00:07:02.868
and you

00:07:02.868 --> 00:07:06.508
do brilliant things with with
your fiction and things like that.

00:07:07.008 --> 00:07:07.368
<v Kylee>Thank you.

00:07:07.368 --> 00:07:07.938
I'm well.

00:07:07.943 --> 00:07:09.548
I'm a Celt by heritage.

00:07:09.548 --> 00:07:14.558
The one, one thing I have a problem with
is being lumped into the whole European

00:07:14.558 --> 00:07:21.728
category of New Zealander, because
European has such a wide cultural mix.

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:24.038
It's not specific enough for me.

00:07:24.038 --> 00:07:28.498
I'm a Celtic New Zealander because  I had
four great grandparents who were Irish

00:07:28.498 --> 00:07:30.778
out of eight, two Welsh and two Scottish.

00:07:30.808 --> 00:07:32.188
So there we are.

00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:37.778
But I went to Homai, for all
of my schooling, I was probably

00:07:37.778 --> 00:07:39.068
one of the last to do that.

00:07:39.068 --> 00:07:42.008
A lot of the kids were
mainstreamed, at least to high

00:07:42.008 --> 00:07:43.988
school by the time I came along.

00:07:43.988 --> 00:07:49.088
But I was one of the last to go
full term from age five to 19.

00:07:49.908 --> 00:07:51.488
<v Dr Pam>It's a long time Kylee.

00:07:51.698 --> 00:07:53.288
<v Kylee>Yes, it is.

00:07:53.288 --> 00:07:55.988
It's a long chunk out of
someone's life and I'm only now

00:07:55.988 --> 00:07:58.838
realizing what impact that had.

00:08:00.098 --> 00:08:04.928
And it's not just realizing, it's
making yourself realize it because

00:08:05.928 --> 00:08:07.968
it's difficult and it's easy to avoid.

00:08:07.968 --> 00:08:11.808
And one thing that I'm learning is
that most human beings are avoidant.

00:08:12.078 --> 00:08:16.488
We tend to not want to know the
dark side of ourselves, the shadow

00:08:16.488 --> 00:08:18.228
self, I think Jung calls it.

00:08:18.978 --> 00:08:21.378
And we tend to avoid those
things because they're difficult.

00:08:21.378 --> 00:08:24.888
We don't wanna see them, we don't
want it to reflect badly on us, or

00:08:24.938 --> 00:08:29.768
we think it will, but it's important
because self-knowledge is a gift.

00:08:29.813 --> 00:08:29.873
Yeah.

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:33.633
Once you start knowing yourself, you
start knowing, your fellow human beings

00:08:33.653 --> 00:08:39.203
better, but you have to make yourself
go through that because you can't go

00:08:39.203 --> 00:08:43.103
around, you can't ignore it because it
just becomes baggage you keep carrying.

00:08:43.373 --> 00:08:44.933
So the only way is through.

00:08:45.293 --> 00:08:47.963
It's the hardest way, but it's
really the only way that works.

00:08:49.913 --> 00:08:57.973
Anyway, I went to Homai and I tried to be
successful in wider society with moderate

00:08:58.513 --> 00:09:03.403
and sporadic successes, and I've only
recently found out why that was too.

00:09:03.403 --> 00:09:09.293
But I started in the public sector
as a typist because I like words.

00:09:09.293 --> 00:09:13.273
I've always been a word sort of a
words are one of my big interests.

00:09:14.563 --> 00:09:17.113
But typing was just
easy  But not copy typing.

00:09:17.293 --> 00:09:21.733
Typing other people's piffle without being
able to correct their grammar was torture.

00:09:22.783 --> 00:09:23.973
<v Dr Pam>It would be

00:09:24.258 --> 00:09:25.008
<v Kylee>it was.

00:09:25.548 --> 00:09:28.518
But the medical typing where I started
actually was the most interesting

00:09:28.518 --> 00:09:31.948
because I had work experience at
Palmie Hospital and that was fun.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.868
I learned something all
the time while I was there.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:39.258
Every time I typed something new, some
different medical discipline, I remember

00:09:39.258 --> 00:09:41.048
once yelling across  the typing pool.

00:09:41.198 --> 00:09:42.968
How do you spell tachycardia?

00:09:43.088 --> 00:09:45.968
And this voice in my
ear spelled it for me.

00:09:45.968 --> 00:09:48.548
And it turned around and there
was the head of coronary care.

00:09:54.348 --> 00:09:57.768
So I got interested in equal employment
opportunities while I was at social

00:09:57.768 --> 00:10:03.663
welfare, because that was my first
paid typing job and it was then that

00:10:03.663 --> 00:10:07.473
I started getting interested in the
disability activism side of things.

00:10:07.743 --> 00:10:11.553
I was never very, what you'd call active,
but I was always interested in learning.

00:10:12.063 --> 00:10:20.313
So I was, I represented our office in EEO
for the time I was there, and then I got a

00:10:20.313 --> 00:10:25.923
job as the Northern Regional Administrator
of the mainstream program, and that's

00:10:25.923 --> 00:10:28.323
where I first came to work under you.

00:10:28.533 --> 00:10:30.453
Because you took over
from Mike Goy, didn't you?

00:10:30.453 --> 00:10:33.783
So you became my boss and we
worked together for a while.

00:10:33.853 --> 00:10:36.733
We had met at Homai before that
When you had your first dog,

00:10:36.988 --> 00:10:37.663
<v Dr Pam>Oh, that's right.

00:10:38.023 --> 00:10:38.293
Yeah.

00:10:38.603 --> 00:10:40.583
And our starts were
actually really similar,

00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:42.413
both being at social welfare, et cetera.

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:43.193
<v Kylee>yes.

00:10:43.223 --> 00:10:43.553
Yeah.

00:10:44.693 --> 00:10:50.273
So I then moved from State Services
Commission when it had, its in

00:10:50.273 --> 00:10:52.913
terminable, restructures 'cause it
was always having those back then.

00:10:53.033 --> 00:10:53.483
<v Dr Pam>Yes.

00:10:53.898 --> 00:10:54.173
Yes, indeed.

00:10:55.628 --> 00:10:58.438
<v Kylee>I moved to the employment
service, which was very exciting,

00:10:58.438 --> 00:11:02.938
very stressful, but it cost me
a lot in terms of my resources.

00:11:03.628 --> 00:11:04.498
I did well at it.

00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:05.338
I enjoyed it.

00:11:05.438 --> 00:11:08.768
I was the person who came in to see
when you looked on the board for a

00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:11.978
job and you then lined up and went to
see one of the people in the cubicles.

00:11:12.158 --> 00:11:17.618
I was one of those back in the
nineties, which was very interesting.

00:11:17.618 --> 00:11:20.938
It was interesting to meet
so many different people with

00:11:20.938 --> 00:11:22.348
so many different skills.

00:11:23.248 --> 00:11:29.278
I first noticed racism when I was
there because we had some foreign

00:11:29.648 --> 00:11:34.628
people who were quite well qualified,
but we couldn't get them jobs.

00:11:36.008 --> 00:11:40.358
And it was my first time that I actually
noticed that sort of thing that outside

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:45.088
the disability sector, and it just was
something that never made sense to me.

00:11:45.088 --> 00:11:49.113
I remember we had one guy who was
stainless steel qualified, in metal work.

00:11:49.113 --> 00:11:51.958
And it was really difficult to
get people who were qualified in

00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.938
stainless steel, but he was Moroccan.

00:11:53.938 --> 00:11:54.868
And do you think we could get it?

00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.578
Oh, it was very frustrating.

00:11:56.938 --> 00:11:57.328
Yeah.

00:11:57.868 --> 00:12:03.618
But so I had a burnout and
I left work after that.

00:12:04.548 --> 00:12:07.638
I now know what that probably was.

00:12:07.668 --> 00:12:11.028
At the time we thought it was
just depression, but depression's

00:12:11.028 --> 00:12:13.668
just a side issue for me, really.

00:12:16.468 --> 00:12:19.318
Because the main cause was my autism.

00:12:19.648 --> 00:12:24.658
So I just found out I'm
autistic last August.

00:12:24.748 --> 00:12:25.613
But we'll get to that.

00:12:26.243 --> 00:12:31.713
So I drifted for a while, but I'd made
an album in 1998 and that was equally

00:12:31.713 --> 00:12:35.588
exciting and stressful because music
had always been a part of the culture

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:40.208
at Homai, you had to do music in some
form, and especially in the girls

00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:45.728
hostel where I grew up, we were always
singing, harmonizing, collaborating

00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:47.288
on music, all that sort of thing.

00:12:47.338 --> 00:12:49.173
<v Dr Pam>What was the
name of your album, Kylee?

00:12:49.193 --> 00:12:50.813
In case people want to have a listen,

00:12:51.008 --> 00:12:52.508
<v Kylee>it was called First Light.

00:12:52.508 --> 00:12:54.698
Now , there's a cut
down version on Spotify.

00:12:54.698 --> 00:12:57.758
I'm not quite sure what it's called,
but if you look for my name on

00:12:57.758 --> 00:12:59.378
Spotify, you probably will find

00:12:59.443 --> 00:13:01.663
<v Dr Pam>We'll find a way
to exit the interview with a

00:13:01.663 --> 00:13:03.103
track if that's okay with you.

00:13:03.498 --> 00:13:04.453
<v Kylee>Yeah, that's fine.

00:13:04.588 --> 00:13:05.608
I can send you a track.

00:13:05.608 --> 00:13:09.008
So yes that was very exciting.

00:13:09.008 --> 00:13:13.078
Although I learned a lot, I learned
how naive I was for a start because

00:13:13.198 --> 00:13:17.548
the distribution was all taken
over by Warners who didn't actually

00:13:17.698 --> 00:13:22.078
participate in the album, but they
got the distribution rights and the

00:13:22.078 --> 00:13:23.158
album actually doesn't belong to me.

00:13:23.158 --> 00:13:24.508
It belongs to Frontier Records.

00:13:25.018 --> 00:13:27.268
So yes, it's all

00:13:27.283 --> 00:13:28.408
<v Dr Pam>But you still get royalties.

00:13:29.038 --> 00:13:31.208
<v Kylee>oh no, it's
all very complicated.

00:13:31.208 --> 00:13:33.908
I think if I did it again,
I'd do it myself because I

00:13:33.908 --> 00:13:35.348
learned to be a broadcaster.

00:13:35.348 --> 00:13:41.778
After that, I went to a school in Porirua
and I was hired by Radio New Zealand

00:13:41.868 --> 00:13:47.098
on the mainstream program again this
time as a spoken features producer.

00:13:47.128 --> 00:13:51.718
And my job was to be a co-presenter
for the one in five program, which

00:13:51.718 --> 00:13:55.978
was on disability on Sunday nights, on
national radio as it was called then.

00:13:56.533 --> 00:13:57.573
<v Dr Pam>Absolutely awesome at it.

00:13:57.748 --> 00:13:58.348
<v Kylee>Oh, thank you.

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:00.028
It was something I did enjoy.

00:14:01.228 --> 00:14:03.988
It was also a very toxic
environment, I've got to say.

00:14:05.098 --> 00:14:10.278
It was very difficult on women
especially I had a friend who did

00:14:10.368 --> 00:14:14.358
the Maori program Te Ahi Kaa and she
and I used to, compare notes all the

00:14:14.358 --> 00:14:16.668
time on the various difficulties.

00:14:16.788 --> 00:14:17.418
Yes.

00:14:17.818 --> 00:14:21.028
But, and creatively it was difficult
because you had to come up with something

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:22.588
every week and that was hard for me.

00:14:22.638 --> 00:14:27.998
Having to be on spec with something,
some piece of news or some piece of

00:14:27.998 --> 00:14:29.648
journalism, I'd rather tell stories.

00:14:29.648 --> 00:14:34.118
I'm a documentary maker, really, not
a journalist, and I didn't often get

00:14:34.118 --> 00:14:39.338
the opportunity to do that wonderful
production thing where I could be creative

00:14:39.948 --> 00:14:41.718
<v Dr Pam>Is that something
that you would consider doing

00:14:41.718 --> 00:14:42.798
again in the future, though?

00:14:43.353 --> 00:14:45.273
<v Kylee>On contract,
I think I would, yes.

00:14:45.273 --> 00:14:49.743
I wouldn't want to be employed again full
time, but on contract, I'd love to do it.

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.123
It was fun.

00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:53.903
And I still do a bit of it now with
my fan fiction but we'll get to that.

00:14:54.403 --> 00:14:59.713
In 2005, I had the opportunity to
go to the Giant Leap Festival, which

00:14:59.713 --> 00:15:03.013
was the inaugural disability arts
festival in the country in Auckland,

00:15:03.853 --> 00:15:06.103
both as a performer and to cover it.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:11.873
And there were four programs that I put
up, no, five actually for one in five.

00:15:13.253 --> 00:15:17.933
One of them was with a woman called
Victoria Maxwell, who is an actor

00:15:17.933 --> 00:15:23.653
from Canada who came here with a one
woman show called Crazy for Life.

00:15:23.653 --> 00:15:26.083
It was her first, she
has several since then.

00:15:26.083 --> 00:15:32.113
She, and she has a particular form
of bipolar called Mixed State rapid

00:15:32.113 --> 00:15:38.683
cycling, which is probably fairly severe
because she can be either up or down

00:15:38.683 --> 00:15:44.083
in one cycle and it cycles rapidly,
it's quite self-explanatory really.

00:15:44.583 --> 00:15:48.703
. She made a wonderful show
and  the interview with her was

00:15:48.703 --> 00:15:54.823
put forward by Mike Gorley's
suggestion for a awards in the us.

00:15:54.823 --> 00:15:59.293
They were doing a, like minds
like mine type campaign that was

00:15:59.353 --> 00:16:03.233
focusing on positive portrayal
of mental health issues.

00:16:03.273 --> 00:16:05.883
That's what our program was
called here, like Minds Like Mine.

00:16:05.933 --> 00:16:10.753
It was a campaign over a few years
if people remember back in the early

00:16:10.753 --> 00:16:16.603
noughties, and eight states had a
similar one, and they had these voice

00:16:16.603 --> 00:16:21.763
awards, which were given to writers and
entertainers in the film, television,

00:16:21.763 --> 00:16:26.623
and radio industries who had appropriate
portrayals of mental health issues.

00:16:26.923 --> 00:16:28.848
And I won an award.

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:30.068
<v Dr Pam>Rightly I

00:16:30.083 --> 00:16:31.048
<v Kylee>I was thinking I was

00:16:31.708 --> 00:16:34.828
<v Dr Pam>it Kylee, but I, if I'd
love to get a hold of a copy, it's

00:16:34.908 --> 00:16:35.788
probably in the archive somewhere.

00:16:37.018 --> 00:16:37.498
<v Kylee>Yes.

00:16:37.548 --> 00:16:38.928
I'm sure we can arrange that.

00:16:39.338 --> 00:16:41.628
I was allowed to take some things
when I left, and one of that

00:16:41.628 --> 00:16:42.588
was one of the things I took.

00:16:42.588 --> 00:16:43.788
So I have a copy.

00:16:43.888 --> 00:16:45.298
Yeah, it probably is in the archives

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:47.858
<v Dr Pam>And you had to travel
to the states to accept that.

00:16:48.488 --> 00:16:52.928
<v Kylee>I did, I could have accepted
it by video, but I really wanted

00:16:52.928 --> 00:16:55.388
to go there and I had never been.

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:57.698
So I went to LA for a week on my own.

00:16:59.378 --> 00:17:01.088
And it was, which was fairly,

00:17:01.263 --> 00:17:01.743
<v Dr Pam>adventure.

00:17:02.108 --> 00:17:06.938
<v Kylee>it was actually,
it was, I stayed in Brentwood,

00:17:06.938 --> 00:17:08.788
which is a fairly nice suburb.

00:17:08.788 --> 00:17:10.798
Was well looked after by the hotel people.

00:17:11.488 --> 00:17:15.448
I ventured out in taxis, you, of
course in LA you can't plan anything.

00:17:15.498 --> 00:17:16.098
It's like.

00:17:16.518 --> 00:17:16.798
Us.

00:17:16.798 --> 00:17:20.998
You can't just drive somewhere
because the traffic is so heavy.

00:17:21.388 --> 00:17:23.338
You've really got to plan where you go.

00:17:23.398 --> 00:17:27.358
And whenever a taxi would arrive for
me, this wonderful woman at the front

00:17:27.358 --> 00:17:31.623
desk would harangue and she was her name
was Edith, she was from El Salvador.

00:17:31.643 --> 00:17:33.163
And she would just stand
there, haranguing him.

00:17:33.163 --> 00:17:35.893
You look after her and you make sure
you take the best route and all.

00:17:36.733 --> 00:17:38.233
It was wonderful.

00:17:38.503 --> 00:17:40.073
<v Dr Pam>Oh, it's great to have allies

00:17:40.113 --> 00:17:41.703
<v Kylee>yes it certainly was.

00:17:41.703 --> 00:17:46.383
And the event itself was hosted
by Marielle Hemingway, who is the

00:17:46.383 --> 00:17:50.823
youngest, I think the youngest
granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway

00:17:52.143 --> 00:17:55.263
and Victoria joined me from Canada.

00:17:55.623 --> 00:17:59.703
And we had other recipients or people
at Larry King, he wasn't there.

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:04.933
But it was quite awe inspiring to be among
these people, me, this little kiwi girl

00:18:04.933 --> 00:18:07.123
I was the only foreigner in this place.

00:18:07.318 --> 00:18:08.758
<v Dr Pam>Would've
been a bit overwhelming.

00:18:09.253 --> 00:18:10.873
<v Kylee>It was, it
felt like the Oscars.

00:18:10.873 --> 00:18:11.413
And I was,

00:18:11.488 --> 00:18:11.778
<v Dr Pam>Yeah.

00:18:12.368 --> 00:18:14.603
<v Kylee>I had a skirt and top
ensemble, actually, I've still got

00:18:14.603 --> 00:18:20.433
the jacket, this gorgeous cream silk
jacket it's got a gorgeous texture and

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:24.243
I've still kept it because it has such
lovely memories associated with it.

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:26.073
But it was certainly an adventure.

00:18:26.493 --> 00:18:29.603
It was in 2006, by the way, by
the time the awards came around.

00:18:29.963 --> 00:18:33.473
I left radio nz after that
because again, it cost me a lot of

00:18:33.473 --> 00:18:36.293
resources to be employed full-time.

00:18:37.013 --> 00:18:37.313
<v Dr Pam>Yeah.

00:18:37.813 --> 00:18:40.873
<v Kylee>And I haven't been
employed full-time since then.

00:18:40.873 --> 00:18:46.213
The only other actual employment
I've had apart from this work,

00:18:46.513 --> 00:18:51.463
it was in 2014 when I was part of
the survey team for the R-N-Z-F-B.

00:18:52.033 --> 00:18:52.213
<v Dr Pam>Yeah.

00:18:52.513 --> 00:18:52.853
<v Kylee>Yes.

00:18:52.853 --> 00:18:55.943
But I have kept myself busy.

00:18:56.003 --> 00:18:59.753
I studied computers online with the
Cisco Academy for the vision impaired

00:18:59.753 --> 00:19:04.013
out of Perth, and I instructed a
class a year later, which was fun.

00:19:04.493 --> 00:19:05.853
<v Dr Pam>What was that like, Kylee?

00:19:05.913 --> 00:19:07.173
Is that course still going?

00:19:07.723 --> 00:19:09.523
<v Kylee>No, it's not, unfortunately.

00:19:10.393 --> 00:19:13.503
It was very interesting because
there were a lot of things

00:19:13.503 --> 00:19:15.123
that really needed hands on.

00:19:15.423 --> 00:19:19.743
And I have to give a big shout out to
Britta Offergeld, our mutual friend

00:19:20.103 --> 00:19:21.603
who actually helped me a lot with that.

00:19:21.603 --> 00:19:21.993
She,

00:19:21.993 --> 00:19:23.103
<v Dr Pam>Of this podcast.

00:19:23.103 --> 00:19:23.583
<v Kylee>yes.

00:19:24.153 --> 00:19:29.163
She was the adaptive, assistive
technology representative  in the

00:19:29.163 --> 00:19:30.363
Wellington office at the time.

00:19:30.363 --> 00:19:34.143
And so because of her background
in networking and alarm systems,

00:19:34.743 --> 00:19:38.523
she could help me do things
like help me to make cables.

00:19:38.523 --> 00:19:42.403
And we could discuss networking,
protocols and bits and pieces.

00:19:42.403 --> 00:19:44.303
So that helped a lot to have Britta here.

00:19:44.353 --> 00:19:49.273
And even her boss Kevin Prince at the time
allowed us to have a play with the server,

00:19:49.723 --> 00:19:53.603
the patch bay in the office so that I
could see how it was all put together.

00:19:54.113 --> 00:19:55.583
And that was fascinating.

00:19:55.633 --> 00:19:55.923
<v Dr Pam>Yeah.

00:19:56.453 --> 00:19:57.623
<v Kylee>We'd never be
allowed now, of course.

00:20:00.083 --> 00:20:00.203
No.

00:20:00.303 --> 00:20:00.823
<v Dr Pam>tell Andrea.

00:20:01.678 --> 00:20:01.898
<v Kylee>No.

00:20:03.238 --> 00:20:08.153
But  it was just something I did because
I wanted to know if I could, because

00:20:08.153 --> 00:20:09.953
I'm not really a mathematical person.

00:20:09.953 --> 00:20:12.773
Although music you could argue,
has a lot of maths in it.

00:20:12.773 --> 00:20:13.553
It does.

00:20:14.283 --> 00:20:19.083
As I could make sure that I understood
the concepts, I would work on it until

00:20:19.083 --> 00:20:20.853
I understood it in layman's terms.

00:20:21.583 --> 00:20:23.173
That was actually quite fascinating.

00:20:23.173 --> 00:20:26.893
And the networking part for me
was probably the most fascinating.

00:20:27.223 --> 00:20:29.273
I would have dreams of, binary code and

00:20:29.963 --> 00:20:30.903
<v Dr Pam>Oh, for goodness sake.

00:20:32.723 --> 00:20:38.703
<v Kylee>I know, yes, I, it's
now, it's one of these obsessions I

00:20:38.703 --> 00:20:40.293
do get rather obsessed with things

00:20:40.433 --> 00:20:42.223
<v Dr Pam>Have you been able
to keep up with things though?

00:20:42.853 --> 00:20:43.903
Computing is just.

00:20:44.403 --> 00:20:45.303
Who can keep up with it?

00:20:45.303 --> 00:20:45.843
Anyway,

00:20:45.963 --> 00:20:50.223
it's developing rapidly and of course
now we've got ai, but did that give

00:20:50.223 --> 00:20:53.848
you a good basis though, to be able
to feel that you could keep up with it

00:20:53.868 --> 00:20:55.568
at least enough for your own benefit?

00:20:56.193 --> 00:20:56.613
<v Kylee>Yes.

00:20:56.613 --> 00:20:58.773
It's made me much more independent.

00:20:58.833 --> 00:21:01.293
When I have a problem, I
can troubleshoot it myself.

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:06.063
Usually I haven't built anything since
then, but I probably could if I wanted to.

00:21:06.613 --> 00:21:09.913
I do have an idea that
I'd like to study more.

00:21:10.253 --> 00:21:13.913
I didn't get to do Linux because
the course that they did that

00:21:13.913 --> 00:21:17.363
followed on from the one I did had
disappeared by then, unfortunately.

00:21:17.363 --> 00:21:21.023
But I'd still like to do that because
there are things like Rasberry PIs

00:21:21.023 --> 00:21:22.403
out there that you can operate.

00:21:23.183 --> 00:21:27.023
Apparently if you hook them up to a
pc, it's called a headless version.

00:21:27.523 --> 00:21:30.313
Which would be quite interesting to
see what I could do with one of those.

00:21:30.503 --> 00:21:31.263
<v Dr Pam>Endless version.

00:21:32.193 --> 00:21:33.633
<v Kylee>Yes.

00:21:33.953 --> 00:21:37.703
And then in  2016, I trained
as a proofreader copy editor.

00:21:38.513 --> 00:21:43.613
So that spoke to my,
my wordsmithing again.

00:21:44.333 --> 00:21:44.993
And

00:21:45.533 --> 00:21:47.883
<v Dr Pam>And these are all things
that you particularly the last

00:21:47.883 --> 00:21:50.973
thing that you, if somebody came
out with a contract, you'd be quite

00:21:50.973 --> 00:21:54.993
interested to do rather than actually
working for someone all the time.

00:21:55.473 --> 00:22:00.773
<v Kylee>yes I'm a creative, I think
I enjoy sound  if I get into producing

00:22:00.813 --> 00:22:07.143
an audio or say a fan fiction of mine,
I will use the 11 lab character voices.

00:22:07.143 --> 00:22:11.613
I like designing the characters, I like
finding the sounds that go with it.

00:22:11.643 --> 00:22:12.843
I like putting it all together.

00:22:13.383 --> 00:22:19.233
You can lose me for hours and hours doing
that sort of thing, or writing the stories

00:22:19.233 --> 00:22:22.863
because it's just, I enjoy creating.

00:22:23.233 --> 00:22:24.433
<v Dr Pam>You talked about fan fiction.

00:22:24.433 --> 00:22:26.808
Do you wanna tell us a
bit more specifically?

00:22:27.308 --> 00:22:28.508
<v Kylee>I'll be 60 in June.

00:22:28.508 --> 00:22:31.808
I would never have thought that
I would be writing fan fiction.

00:22:31.808 --> 00:22:38.588
It's got a certain odor to it in
the wider creative world and that is

00:22:38.588 --> 00:22:39.998
partially deserved, but only partial.

00:22:41.768 --> 00:22:46.808
It's a whole culture in of itself,
and I've had to approach it as an

00:22:46.808 --> 00:22:53.018
anthropologist might in many ways, and
I still really am on the periphery, but

00:22:54.008 --> 00:22:56.978
I read the Harry Potter books in 2021.

00:22:56.978 --> 00:22:58.808
I finally decided to read them.

00:22:59.318 --> 00:23:04.088
I avoided them for 20 years because
my favorite author, the Late Great

00:23:04.088 --> 00:23:07.868
sir Terry Pratchett, had been a
bit scathing for many reasons.

00:23:07.868 --> 00:23:13.508
And I think Ursula K Le Guin, another
very famous sci-fi writer had also been a

00:23:13.508 --> 00:23:18.608
bit concerned about some of the concepts,
but I thought I'll just pick them up

00:23:18.608 --> 00:23:19.838
to see what all the fuss was about.

00:23:19.868 --> 00:23:23.108
The whole heap of books on my
list that I want to do that.

00:23:23.238 --> 00:23:26.328
And it broke me open pretty much.

00:23:26.358 --> 00:23:29.238
And it what it was about
pattern recognition.

00:23:29.238 --> 00:23:33.408
As soon as I came across
Severus Snape, I recognized.

00:23:33.828 --> 00:23:38.358
The kind of person I'd grown up
with, a kind of adult, especially

00:23:38.388 --> 00:23:42.348
in the hostel side, but in the
teacher side in some cases.

00:23:42.948 --> 00:23:47.898
But this whole pattern of it's
okay to abuse these kids because

00:23:47.898 --> 00:23:50.148
of how I feel as a person.

00:23:50.628 --> 00:23:56.568
I take my personal issues with me
everywhere I go and I project them

00:23:56.568 --> 00:23:59.088
onto the children because I can.

00:23:59.888 --> 00:24:01.713
<v Dr Pam>He's certainly
like that isn't he Severus

00:24:01.998 --> 00:24:02.628
<v Kylee>Yes.

00:24:02.748 --> 00:24:04.068
Yeah, exactly.

00:24:04.488 --> 00:24:05.178
<v Dr Pam>teachers like.

00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:07.758
<v Kylee>Oh yeah.

00:24:07.938 --> 00:24:09.588
Teachers and staff.

00:24:10.088 --> 00:24:14.048
I think the matron was the
closest fit though, because there

00:24:14.048 --> 00:24:15.968
was the same jealousy there.

00:24:16.748 --> 00:24:21.518
I had a mother who was raised in
the rural west coast of the south

00:24:21.518 --> 00:24:26.678
island, and she could knit and
crochet and sew without a pattern.

00:24:26.678 --> 00:24:31.778
She could just dream something up and
make it and I don't think that the

00:24:31.778 --> 00:24:35.498
matron, I'm not gonna mention her name,
she is dead, but out of a residual

00:24:35.498 --> 00:24:37.538
respect, I won't think she was jealous.

00:24:37.538 --> 00:24:38.678
I spoke well.

00:24:39.278 --> 00:24:43.268
I was fairly assertive and I had
these nice clothes that actually

00:24:43.268 --> 00:24:44.378
didn't cost a lot to make.

00:24:44.378 --> 00:24:46.088
You couldn't buy, when we were growing up,

00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:49.988
you couldn't buy clothes
from the far east cheap ones.

00:24:50.288 --> 00:24:54.368
So either you paid quite a lot
of money for reasonable clothes,

00:24:54.558 --> 00:24:55.818
or your parents made them.

00:24:56.208 --> 00:24:56.988
It was as simple as that.

00:24:57.488 --> 00:25:00.128
Yeah, it wasn't just me that she targeted.

00:25:00.128 --> 00:25:03.638
There were other people, some other
survivors who I know who've also

00:25:03.638 --> 00:25:05.318
said they were targeted by her.

00:25:05.468 --> 00:25:09.368
And I have never, and we'll never
know why that is, but I think there

00:25:09.368 --> 00:25:14.138
was some jealousy there, or some
perhaps personal issue, which.

00:25:14.408 --> 00:25:18.848
It caused her hackles to be raised
by some of us in particular.

00:25:20.108 --> 00:25:20.258
<v Dr Pam>I

00:25:20.258 --> 00:25:25.298
wonder, Kylee, whether some people have
the view, if they're non-disabled or

00:25:25.298 --> 00:25:30.258
if they're European, if they're working
with children of color, but if they're

00:25:30.258 --> 00:25:34.808
working with disabled children, I
wonder it's you need to be absolutely

00:25:34.808 --> 00:25:37.688
aware of your marginalized position.

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:41.918
You are not really members of society
unless we give you permission to

00:25:41.918 --> 00:25:47.148
be, how dare you behave in an uppity
manner, all of that kind of thing,

00:25:47.753 --> 00:25:49.103
<v Kylee>I would go further than that.

00:25:49.103 --> 00:25:54.323
I think that there is this tacit
belief among many people, although they

00:25:54.323 --> 00:25:58.223
would be shocked to hear me say this,
that we are actually not fully human.

00:25:58.793 --> 00:26:00.983
We don't have the same depth of feeling.

00:26:01.203 --> 00:26:03.833
They think we don't have the
same dreams and aspirations.

00:26:04.283 --> 00:26:06.593
It's, yeah, it goes to that level I think.

00:26:07.058 --> 00:26:07.693
<v Dr Pam>You are correct.

00:26:07.898 --> 00:26:10.688
'cause when I think about it, I can
think of at least two people who

00:26:10.688 --> 00:26:15.188
have actually said that to me, to
my face, not me, but talking about

00:26:15.188 --> 00:26:16.958
people with learning disabilities.

00:26:17.318 --> 00:26:19.878
That the, there a drain
on society, et cetera, and

00:26:19.928 --> 00:26:22.918
Oh my fingers and my fists twitch when I

00:26:22.918 --> 00:26:24.028
hear people because

00:26:24.043 --> 00:26:24.523
<v Kylee>yeah.

00:26:24.523 --> 00:26:25.513
Mine as well.

00:26:25.513 --> 00:26:26.503
Yes.

00:26:26.563 --> 00:26:27.043
Yeah.

00:26:28.303 --> 00:26:31.293
But there is that tacit belief and
I'd like to think we are losing it,

00:26:31.343 --> 00:26:35.843
but at the moment, I think we are
regressing in terms of the way disabled

00:26:35.843 --> 00:26:37.933
people are being treated in general,

00:26:38.038 --> 00:26:40.888
<v Dr Pam>People are really emboldened
to be quite nasty today, aren't they?

00:26:41.353 --> 00:26:41.953
<v Kylee>Yes.

00:26:42.733 --> 00:26:43.063
Yeah

00:26:43.723 --> 00:26:44.173
<v Dr Pam>yes.

00:26:44.503 --> 00:26:46.753
How many fan fiction
books have you written?

00:26:46.843 --> 00:26:52.923
So these have all been on the subject of
the Harry Potter story or different ones.

00:26:53.368 --> 00:26:53.638
<v Kylee>Yes.

00:26:53.638 --> 00:26:54.838
They're all on Harry Potter.

00:26:54.838 --> 00:27:00.298
What I'm trying to do is change the
narrative of Snape he's actually quite a

00:27:00.298 --> 00:27:06.028
phenomenon as a character, I don't know
of any other character in any book who

00:27:06.028 --> 00:27:14.288
causes a quite such a division of attitude
and b who was so popular either way.

00:27:14.828 --> 00:27:18.518
There are people out there who
worship him, and I do mean that.

00:27:19.028 --> 00:27:22.988
Back in the early naughties I found
out there was a live journal group of

00:27:22.988 --> 00:27:28.598
mainly middle-aged women who called
themselves Snapeists or Snape wives.

00:27:29.528 --> 00:27:32.558
They treated him as their master.

00:27:32.558 --> 00:27:36.758
They would hold fantasy weddings with him.

00:27:36.968 --> 00:27:39.848
The whole thing, it really was a religion.

00:27:40.343 --> 00:27:43.283
<v Dr Pam>Imagine AI
now inject AI into that,

00:27:43.343 --> 00:27:47.063
and then you've got this real whole
ecosystem happening that could be.

00:27:48.773 --> 00:27:49.823
<v Kylee>It is dangerous.

00:27:49.823 --> 00:27:56.303
Even in YouTube now, there are all these
fantasy, they're very well done, but a

00:27:56.303 --> 00:28:00.638
lot of them are on Snape being and I think
Alan Rickman's portrayal in the movies

00:28:00.828 --> 00:28:06.258
has had a lot to do with this, and I'm
sure the late great Alan Rickman would

00:28:06.258 --> 00:28:10.578
be horrified because from what I read
about him, he was a highly principled man.

00:28:10.908 --> 00:28:14.988
I'm sure he would be horrified
to think that his voice, would be

00:28:14.988 --> 00:28:20.673
turned into AI and used for this
unhealthily, oh, man, possessing

00:28:20.678 --> 00:28:23.528
a woman type style of production.

00:28:23.768 --> 00:28:29.048
But YouTube, it's all over
YouTube, but the stories that I

00:28:29.048 --> 00:28:32.828
write are about redemption because
I don't think he was redeemed.

00:28:32.828 --> 00:28:34.298
I think the potential was there.

00:28:35.813 --> 00:28:38.243
So that's what made me sad
when he was killed off.

00:28:38.293 --> 00:28:44.023
Not that because he was redeemed by his
love of Lily, but the potential was there.

00:28:45.373 --> 00:28:49.693
And so I thought I wonder what
would happen if we worked on

00:28:49.693 --> 00:28:52.393
that potential, because that, for
me, that changes the narrative.

00:28:52.633 --> 00:28:57.423
I can't talk to this matron or my other
abusers to ask them why they did what

00:28:57.423 --> 00:28:59.853
they did, but this is what I can do.

00:29:01.413 --> 00:29:03.933
So it's, it becomes a
healthy thing for me.

00:29:04.263 --> 00:29:04.683
<v Dr Pam>yes.

00:29:05.283 --> 00:29:07.113
<v Kylee>A way of
working through issues.

00:29:07.383 --> 00:29:08.313
<v Dr Pam>really well put.

00:29:08.553 --> 00:29:08.853
Yeah.

00:29:09.813 --> 00:29:14.583
And so you brought us full circle to
something else I wanted to ask you

00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:16.433
about, which was you're a gym bunny.

00:29:17.483 --> 00:29:22.433
<v Kylee>Yes, I, P.E. Was
a nightmare for me at Homai.

00:29:22.458 --> 00:29:28.418
I couldn't do most of the things
my proprioception is not great.

00:29:29.108 --> 00:29:33.253
Part of autism I now have discovered
and in my interception as well.

00:29:33.613 --> 00:29:36.523
So my body will tell me things even
though my mind isn't telling me.

00:29:36.523 --> 00:29:40.513
So if I'm stressed, my body will react
in a certain way, even if I don't

00:29:41.383 --> 00:29:45.043
acknowledge that I feel stressed or
that I don't notice things like that.

00:29:45.043 --> 00:29:50.623
And there's a disconnect, but we were,
running athletics 'cause that was the

00:29:50.623 --> 00:29:53.973
focus of our pe if it wasn't in games.

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:57.393
But the one thing we never
did was weightlifting.

00:29:57.453 --> 00:29:59.973
And it's the one thing
I found I'm good at.

00:30:00.273 --> 00:30:01.173
I'm built for it.

00:30:01.173 --> 00:30:03.483
I'm short, I'm in proportion.

00:30:03.963 --> 00:30:05.883
And I love lifting.

00:30:06.043 --> 00:30:10.543
It's mainly on machines now, but I've
just started seriously getting into the

00:30:10.543 --> 00:30:16.963
power lifting, which is three disciplines,
deadlift, bench press, and squat.

00:30:17.683 --> 00:30:20.533
<v Dr Pam>So do you do that thing,
I think it might be the bench press.

00:30:20.533 --> 00:30:24.823
Do you do that thing where you lie on
your back and then you've got to get the

00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:27.463
weight and push it up towards the ceiling?

00:30:27.763 --> 00:30:29.023
<v Kylee>Yes, that's the bench press.

00:30:29.083 --> 00:30:33.453
<v Dr Pam>I can't do, because
I lose all my sense of where

00:30:33.453 --> 00:30:36.513
things are and I wobble and I'm
not sure where the ceiling is.

00:30:36.513 --> 00:30:40.473
It's quite when I've got heavy weights
in my head because I've got excuses now.

00:30:40.473 --> 00:30:41.763
Having broken my wrist

00:30:42.183 --> 00:30:44.218
Last year I just can't do that.

00:30:44.278 --> 00:30:47.998
And the other thing I can't do is
squat because I have chronic sciatica.

00:30:48.208 --> 00:30:48.328
And

00:30:48.358 --> 00:30:52.438
I'll tell you honestly, I don't
miss not being able to do squat.

00:30:52.798 --> 00:30:53.548
They're awful.

00:30:54.898 --> 00:30:55.348
But you do.

00:30:55.423 --> 00:30:57.733
<v Kylee>I had, yeah, I enjoy it.

00:30:57.943 --> 00:31:00.943
I can get up off the floor without
help, quite happily still, which,

00:31:01.043 --> 00:31:02.813
not everyone my age can do that.

00:31:02.843 --> 00:31:07.033
Apparently I hold the female record
in the gym, it's therapeutic because

00:31:07.573 --> 00:31:11.293
it's about overlaying negative
memories with positive ones.

00:31:11.483 --> 00:31:11.703
<v Dr Pam>Yes.

00:31:12.488 --> 00:31:15.778
<v Kylee>That's what all this is about
for me now in this time of my life.

00:31:16.278 --> 00:31:17.688
<v Dr Pam>Just sounds really awesome.

00:31:17.688 --> 00:31:22.228
And I think a lot of people listening
are going to be thinking, wow, it's

00:31:22.228 --> 00:31:26.788
good to have role models who can do
that, who can find their ways through

00:31:27.358 --> 00:31:32.338
a forest of, often very negative
experiences, but come out the other

00:31:32.338 --> 00:31:36.638
side or at least begin doing that and
pass that knowledge and that wisdom on

00:31:37.138 --> 00:31:40.488
a lot of people wouldn't do that, so I
really thank you for doing that, Kylee.

00:31:40.988 --> 00:31:41.778
<v Kylee>It's my pleasure.

00:31:41.778 --> 00:31:43.158
It's something I enjoy.

00:31:43.218 --> 00:31:44.898
I enjoy passing on what I have.

00:31:45.138 --> 00:31:50.148
I enjoy being useful, but I actually
am so seldom allowed to be useful.

00:31:50.388 --> 00:31:51.018
So

00:31:51.558 --> 00:31:51.888
it's

00:31:52.053 --> 00:31:53.928
<v Dr Pam>we want you
in the disability sector.

00:31:53.928 --> 00:31:55.038
You could be very useful.

00:31:55.038 --> 00:31:55.638
I'm sure.

00:31:58.248 --> 00:31:58.758
<v Kylee>yes,

00:31:58.818 --> 00:32:01.128
<v Dr Pam>a role model and
lots of other things too.

00:32:01.128 --> 00:32:06.828
You've got lots of talents and I really
hope that you get further opportunities

00:32:06.828 --> 00:32:10.298
that you want and not the ones you
don't 'cause, sometimes we're offered

00:32:10.298 --> 00:32:12.968
things and we refuse them, and people
think we're awfully ungrateful.

00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:16.508
But if it's going to, as you say,
deplete your resources, there's

00:32:16.508 --> 00:32:17.798
no point in accepting those.

00:32:18.613 --> 00:32:19.103
<v Kylee>exactly.

00:32:19.203 --> 00:32:20.978
And now I have that knowledge.

00:32:21.338 --> 00:32:25.838
I also have complex PTSD and classic
PTSD that was diagnosed at the same

00:32:25.838 --> 00:32:28.918
time, so that knowledge is good.

00:32:28.918 --> 00:32:31.758
It's, people might think,
oh that's a terrible thing.

00:32:31.968 --> 00:32:36.308
But none of it is it's all knowledge and
knowledge is a gift, until you can name

00:32:36.308 --> 00:32:38.888
a thing and then fully recognizing it.

00:32:38.888 --> 00:32:41.678
And that's actually the hard
part for full recognition.

00:32:41.888 --> 00:32:42.908
Naming is easy.

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:47.378
Full recognition of what it means is
difficult, but unless you do that, you

00:32:47.378 --> 00:32:49.173
can't actually use what you've got.

00:32:49.673 --> 00:32:53.638
<v Dr Pam>That brings to mind something
that I've heard quite a lot and I've

00:32:53.758 --> 00:33:00.568
often wondered about myself is naming
something, I hear what you're saying,

00:33:00.598 --> 00:33:04.238
but there's more, people say okay,
if you've got those things, you've

00:33:04.238 --> 00:33:07.598
still got them, whether you name them
or not, what good does it do you?

00:33:07.988 --> 00:33:11.358
But I think what I'm hearing you
say is, it does you good, because

00:33:11.358 --> 00:33:15.738
then with self knowledge, you can
work your way through or around

00:33:15.738 --> 00:33:18.168
those things to have a better life.

00:33:18.768 --> 00:33:19.308
<v Kylee>Yes.

00:33:19.308 --> 00:33:22.158
I think through is the only
way, around is avoidance.

00:33:22.578 --> 00:33:27.108
And that's something I learned rec only
recently because people used to ask me,

00:33:28.198 --> 00:33:30.028
don't you ever think of what you lost?

00:33:30.118 --> 00:33:33.268
Because I used to talk about
my burnout as a nervous break.

00:33:33.298 --> 00:33:36.448
I suppose it was a breakdown, but it
really was autistic burnout, I think.

00:33:37.108 --> 00:33:38.818
I think it's probably what it was.

00:33:39.368 --> 00:33:43.178
And I used to say no, there's
no point in going there, which

00:33:43.178 --> 00:33:44.498
is actually what was wrong.

00:33:44.498 --> 00:33:50.708
Because what I would have done if
I had known better was yes, it's

00:33:50.708 --> 00:33:54.938
important to recognize it fully because
you can't process it until you do.

00:33:55.688 --> 00:33:57.698
So avoiding, you can't work around it.

00:33:57.698 --> 00:34:00.008
You have to go through
and that's difficult.

00:34:00.008 --> 00:34:03.368
And most people just don't go
there because it's too hard.

00:34:03.848 --> 00:34:04.208
<v Dr Pam>Yeah.

00:34:05.523 --> 00:34:10.433
I think you're right and I think that
everybody you can't get to almost 60, or

00:34:10.433 --> 00:34:15.863
in my case, not that far off 70 without
having gone through a reasonable amount

00:34:15.863 --> 00:34:17.723
of trauma of some sort or another.

00:34:17.723 --> 00:34:22.563
If you can do that and you live your life
without that you're a very unusual person.

00:34:22.563 --> 00:34:23.593
As far as I'm concerned

00:34:24.193 --> 00:34:26.983
Kylee, it's been really
fascinating interviewing you.

00:34:26.983 --> 00:34:31.243
Gosh, I've known you for so long, and yet
I've learned heaps just in this process.

00:34:31.963 --> 00:34:35.913
Is there anything else that you'd
like to mention or tell people about?

00:34:38.103 --> 00:34:43.023
<v Kylee>No, I think that if I wanted
to say anything to the fellow disabled

00:34:43.023 --> 00:34:49.623
people out there is, don't shy away
from who you are and what has happened

00:34:49.623 --> 00:34:54.733
to you, whoever you are, I think to, to
the whole audience really, because it's

00:34:54.733 --> 00:34:58.173
important , but don't do it alone either.

00:34:58.233 --> 00:34:59.073
Always have support.

00:34:59.073 --> 00:35:01.503
I have had therapy for
the last three years.

00:35:01.773 --> 00:35:05.703
I'm very lucky to be funded by enabling
good lives here in Palmerston North,

00:35:05.703 --> 00:35:07.563
which has allowed me to have these things.

00:35:08.113 --> 00:35:13.213
But it's important to shake hands with
all of yourself, including the shadow,

00:35:13.393 --> 00:35:14.773
because that's part of who you are.

00:35:15.973 --> 00:35:20.173
And I think if I can encourage
anyone to do anything, it's.

00:35:20.673 --> 00:35:23.223
Just recognize yourself.

00:35:24.663 --> 00:35:25.593
Recognize yourself.

00:35:25.623 --> 00:35:25.893
Yeah.

00:35:26.163 --> 00:35:26.613
That's it.

00:35:26.733 --> 00:35:30.753
Recognize yourself in all your facets.

00:35:31.168 --> 00:35:32.668
<v Dr Pam>and bring
your whole self to every

00:35:33.003 --> 00:35:33.293
<v Kylee>Yeah.

00:35:33.713 --> 00:35:33.983
<v Dr Pam>Yeah.

00:35:34.403 --> 00:35:35.438
Hey, thank you Kylee.

00:35:35.458 --> 00:35:36.718

And we're gonna go out
on one of your songs,

00:35:40.473 --> 00:35:41.553
